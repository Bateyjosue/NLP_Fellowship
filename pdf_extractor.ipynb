Ferdinand Wanyonyi. \\n \\n\\nPUBLICATION OF REGULATIONS ON PRIVATE \\n\\nLAND USE AND MANAGEMENT \\n\\n \\nHon. Ferdinand Wanyonyi (Kwanza, FORD-K): Hon. Speaker, I beg to give Notice \\n\\nof the following Motion:  \\n\\nTHAT, aware that Article 68(c)(i) of the Constitution of Kenya provides \\nfor the minimum and maximum holding acreages with respect to private land; \\ndeeply concerned, that with the high population growth and the demand for land \\nhas  resulted  in  the  excessive  transformation  of  land  into  an  economical  unit; \\nnoting that, at the same time, the number of people who own large tracts of land \\nwhich are not utilized optimally is ignorant of the fact that the Constitution in \\nArticle 60 states out the principles of the land policy which among other things \\nrequires that land in Kenya shall be held, used and managed in a manner that is \\nequitable, efficient, productive and sustainable.   \\n\\nThis  House,  therefore,  resolves  that  the  Government  enforces  Article  68(c)(i)  of  the \\nConstitution and Section 158 of the Land Act, 2012 and National Land Policy Sessional Paper \\nNo. 3 of 2009 on the maximum and minimum land holdings in Kenya through the publishing \\nof  the  rules  and  regulations  for  the  private  land  use  and  management  with  regard  to  the \\nminimum and maximum land holdings in Kenya.   \\n\\nThank you, Hon.

Speaker. \\nPursuant to the provisions of Standing Order No. 44(2) (a), I rise to give the following \\nStatement on behalf of the House Business Committee which met on Tuesday, 11th October \\n2022 in the afternoon following its formation to prioritise Business for consideration.  Members \\nwill recall that yesterday, Wednesday, 12th October 2022, in accordance with the provisions of \\nStanding Order 28, this House approved the calendar of the National Assembly for the regular \\nsessions of the First Session. Therefore, the House is now scheduled to proceed for its recess \\ntomorrow, Friday, 14th October 2022, and resume the regular Sittings on Tuesday, 25th October \\n2022. \\n \\nHon. Speaker, for the information of Members, during the recess, the Committee on \\nAppointments  is  expected  to  undertake  the  vetting  of  persons  who  are  nominated  to  the \\npositions of Cabinet Secretaries, Attorney-General and the Secretary to the Cabinet, and table \\nits Report on this matter when we resume regular Sittings. Further, the Committee on Selection \\nwill also consider the placement of Members in  the various parliamentary committees. This \\nwill, therefore, be a working recess for those of us who sit in the Committee on Appointments \\nand the Committee on Selection. I urge the House to be patient as these processes are ongoing \\nand take the opportunity of this short break, as we said yesterday, to connect or bond with our \\nfamilies and constituents.  Following the elections that we had, many  of us have not  had an \\nopportunity to go back to our constituencies and families. \\nFinally, the House Business Committee (HBC) will reconvene on 25th October 2022 to \\n \\nschedule the business for the week of resumption of the House. I now wish to lay this Statement \\non the Table of the House. \\n \\n \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. \\n\\n(Hon.

Speaker: Leader of the Majority Party. \\nHon. Kimani Ichung'wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Hon. Speaker, I beg to move the following \\n\\n \\n \\nMotion: \\n\\nTHAT,  acknowledging  that  the  East  Africa  Legislative  Assembly  (EALA)  is \\nestablished  under  Article  9  of  the  Treaty  for  the  Establishment  of  the  East  African \\nCommunity as one of the key organs and institutions of the Community responsible for \\nthe Community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legislative matters; recognising that, Article 50 of the Treaty provides \\nfor  the  election  of  Members  of  EALA  by  respective  partner  States\\xe2\\x80\\x99  Legislatures  in \\naccordance with their parliamentary procedures for a term of five years; further aware \\nthat,  the  East  African  Legislative  Assembly  Elections  Act,  2011  contemplates \\nconclusion of the election of Members of a new Assembly to be within 90 days before \\nthe expiry of the term of the subsisting Assembly; noting that, the term of the current \\nEast African Legislative Assembly lapses on 17th December 2022; cognisant of the need \\nto urgently conclude the election process for the East African Legislative Assembly to \\ncommence transacting business of the East African Community; \\n\\nNow therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 9 of the Houses of \\n\\nParliament (Joint Sittings) Rules, the House resolves: \\n\\n1.  To establish a Joint Committee consisting of seven Members appointed \\nby  each  of  the  Houses  of  Parliament  to  undertake  the  functions \\ncontemplated  under  the  East  African  Legislative  Assembly  Elections \\n(Election of Members of the Assembly) Rules, 2017; \\n\\n2.  That  the following Members shall represent  the National  Assembly in \\n\\nthe Joint Committee: \\n\\n(a)  Hon. Wanjiku Muhia - Co-Chairperson \\n(b) Hon. John Mutunga Kanyuithia \\n(c)  Hon. Daniel Nanok Epuyo, \\n(d) Hon. Francis Sigei Kipyegon \\n(e)  Hon. Ruth Adhiambo Busia \\n(f)  Hon. (Dr.) Makali Mulu, CBS and  \\n(g) Hon. Sabina Chege, CBS \\n\\n3.  That the Offices of the Clerks of the Houses of Parliament shall provide \\nsecretariat  services  to  the  Joint  Committee  in  accordance  with  the \\nStanding Orders; and \\n\\n4.  That the Joint Committee shall report to the House within the timelines \\nstipulated in the East African Legislative Assembly Elections (Election \\nof Members of the Assembly) Rules, 2017. \\n\\n \\nAs I have stated in the Motion, the EALA is an independent legislative arm of our East \\nAfrican  Community  (EAC)  that  was  established  under  Article  9  of  the  EAC  Treaty.  As \\nMembers are aware and for the benefit of our new Members, we have nine Members who are \\nelected by  each partner  State. Kenya being  a partner State  in  the Community, we  will elect \\nthese nine Members. The purpose of this Joint Committee is to guide us through the process of \\nelecting  these  Members.  That  is  why  you  see  that  we  have  representation  from  across  the \\npolitical  divide,  representing  all  our  parliamentary  political  parties.  We  assume  that  the \\ninterests  of  the  non-parliamentary  political  parties  are  catered  for  under  our  coalitions. \\nHowever, the list of names that we have submitted have representation from all parliamentary \\npolitical parties. \\nEALA plays a very critical role in furtherance of the EAC objectives such as liaising \\n \\nwith the National Assemblies of the partner States on matters relating to the Community. It \\nalso debates and approves the Budget of the Community. It also considers the annual Reports \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c13th October 2022                       NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                               4 \\n\\non the activities of the Community, annual audit reports and any other report. It also discusses \\nall matters regarding the Community and makes recommendations, as it may deem necessary, \\nfor the implementation of the Community treaty. \\n \\nRule 9 of the Houses of Parliament for Joint Sittings, as  I said,  establishes the Joint \\nCommittee by way of a Motion which we have just tabled. It consists of membership from both \\nHouses. This list that we are approving here is that of the National Assembly. The other House \\nwill also have its list. That is why we have designated Hon. Wanjiku Muhia who is not only a \\nranking Member of the House but she is also an immediate former Member of EALA. So, she \\nis very well-versed with the affairs of EALA and the provisions of the EAC Treaty, and what \\nneeds to be done. \\n \\nAs I mentioned earlier, the term of the fourth Assembly that Hon. Wanjiku Muhia and  \\nHon. Jematiah, who is also here, are Members comes to an end on 17th December this year. \\nThe fifth Assembly is expected to commence its sittings early in 2023. Therefore, Members \\nknow that the Parliament of Kenya is required to conduct the election of its Members to EALA \\nlatest by 17th December 2022. However, the elections were not carried out immediately as the \\n12th Parliament ended on 10th June. Members remember that we took our sine die adjournment \\nin June. We could not carry out the elections for the Members who would have replaced the \\noutgoing ones. Therefore, this 13th Parliament is required to conclude this process urgently for \\nthe EALA to commence transacting its business, and avoid the scenario that we witnessed in \\nthe last elections of the Members of the Assembly in 2017. We are within time. However, it is \\nvery  important  to  establish  this  Committee,  before  we  go  on  recess  from  tomorrow.  As  the \\nother  two  Committees\\xe2\\x80\\x94Committee  on  Appointments  and  Committee  on  Selection\\xe2\\x80\\x94  are \\nworking, they may also now reconstitute and begin to prepare the timetable and programme \\nthat will guide us to conduct the elections. They will also guide us on when they will advertise \\nfor the positions. The entire timetable is to enable us come back and elect our new Members to \\nEALA. With the passage of this Motion and that in the Senate, it may as well serve as a notice \\nto those who are out there. Nobody seated here is electable to EALA but I know many of our \\ncolleagues whom we were with in the 12th Parliament who are interested. They may as well be \\nnotified through the passage of this Motion that the process has begun and they can therefore \\nbegin their campaigns and they will be guided by the Committee.  \\n\\nWith those many remarks, I beg to move. I will ask the Leader of the Minority Party, \\n\\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi, to second this Motion.  \\n\\nThank you. \\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja, ODM): Hon. Speaker, I wish to second the Motion for \\nthe adoption of the six names to form part of the Joint Committee that will oversee election of \\nMembers to EALA.  \\n\\nWithout  belabouring  the  point,  we  cannot  get  the  importance  of  EALA  in  a  wider \\ncontext of our desire as East Africans to eventually end up within one political federation. It is \\ntherefore  in  our  interest  that  EALA  continues  to  play  its  rightful  role,  and  continues  to  get \\nstrengthened so that as East Africans, we will eventually bring down all artificial barriers that \\ndivide our people. \\n\\n It is also important that we go about these elections properly as envisaged by the East \\nAfrican Community Treaty. It is on record that previously, when we did not get it right, the \\ncourts had to intervene. Indeed, the East African Court of Justice in the Prof. Anyang Nyong\\xe2\\x80\\x99o\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\ncase settled the matter of how to go about election of Members to EALA by respective partner \\nstates.  \\n\\nThis  House,  by  approving  these  names  this  afternoon,  will  have  played  its  part  in \\nensuring that we abide by the rules, treaty and by our own statute to ensure we end up with \\nnames of people who will be elected to EALA representing Kenya as a partner State.

They are Members who are well equipped and have the capacity \\nto steer this important process.  \\n\\nWithout further ado, I second. \\nHon. Speaker: They have written as Busia but I am told\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Is it correct? \\nHon. Members: Yes.  \\nHon. Speaker: I was told to apologise for calling you Busia but, if it is your name, we \\n\\nwill then leave it there. \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon.  Members,  before  we  open  the  debate,  allow  me  to  acknowledge  the  following \\nvisiting schools who are seated in the Public Gallery. They are: St. Teresa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Primary School, \\nKericho  County;  Karugia  Secondary  School,  Murang\\xe2\\x80\\x99a  County;  and  Katwala  Secondary \\nSchool,  Kitui  County.  I  would  also  like  to  acknowledge  Jabali  Christian  School,  Nairobi \\nCounty,  who  are  seated  in  the  Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Gallery.  On  my  behalf,  and  that  of  the  House,  we \\nwelcome the visiting schools to Parliament.  \\n\\nThis matter is too important to truncate it that way. We will need  you to\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 As Hon. \\nWanjiku  Muhia  speaks,  we  have  Members  with  physical  challenges  who  sit  at  the  back. \\nSometimes your cards do not appear on the screen because of the sheer numbers. Like now, we \\nhave 78 Members but  only 20 appear. Other Members would walk  all the way to  lobby for \\nrecognition; but in the event any one of you wants to speak, you can send one of the Serjeant-\\nat-Arms to come and inform the Chair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n (Applause) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Wanjiku, you can proceed. \\nHon. Wanjiku Muhia (Kipipiri, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me an \\nopportunity to speak to this very important Motion which happens to be my area of interest \\nsince I have just concluded my term as a representative in EALA.   \\n\\nKindly, allow me to appreciate the people of Kipipiri for electing me because this is my \\nMaiden Speech. They made a statement in this country that it is no longer about the big names, \\nmoney,  deep  state,  chiefs  or  nyumba  kumi  that  will  stop  the  voice  of  Wanjiku  to  vote  for \\nWanjiku. For that, I want to confirm to them that surely their vote was their choice as the saying \\ngoes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy vote, my choice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I am ready to serve them considering that Kipipiri is one of the \\nleast developed possibly in the whole of Mt. Kenya.  \\n\\nSpeaking of roads, we have pathetic ones. We do not  have water. When it comes to \\nelectricity connectivity, we are lagging behind and are still in darkness in spite of us having \\nhad great leaders as representatives of Kipipiri.  \\n\\nDuring the campaigns, we saw contractors build roads day and night. And for the last \\none month, the roads which were moving very fast in construction are no longer going on. I do \\nnot know where they got the money then that is not available today.nHon. Speaker, the money \\nis not there anymore. I want to ask\\xe2\\x80\\xa6  \\n \\nEALA. \\n \\nstand guided.  \\n \\n\\nHon. Wanjiku Muhia (Kipipiri, UDA):  Hon. Speaker, this is  my Maiden Speech.  I \\n\\nHon.  Speaker:  The  Hon.  Wanjiku  Muhia,  I  do  not  know  what  that  has  to  do  with \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Speaker: Order Members. I would forgive you if you are coming to this House \\n\\n \\nfor the first time. You are not a new Member. \\n \\nHon.  Wanjiku  Muhia  (Kipipiri,  UDA):  Hon.  Speaker,  I  stand  guided.  I  was  on  a \\ncommercial break, although a regional break. However, I wanted to sneak a caution to Stainless \\nSteel Contractors to be faster in the roads that are really not moving in Kipipiri.  \\n\\nHaving  said  that,  let  us  support  the  Members  selected  in  handling  this  matter.  I  am \\nconfirming  to  this  House  that  I  am  aware  that  all  partner  states  in  the  region  have  already \\nconcluded the election of their Members. \\n \\nI also want to remind Members that in 2017, the partner state Kenya delayed the chance \\nfor EALA to start the activities by a whole six months. All other partner states had elected their \\nMembers, and only Kenya had not because of the political issues that we had. The treaty speaks \\nof quorum in the House in EALA. No business  can be transacted if a partner state does not \\nhave three Members present in the House. For that reason, EALA could not transact business \\nfor six months and Members really struggled. Therefore, let us fast track this. It is 90 days and \\naccording to EALA Act, Section 12, it requires the respective Parliaments to make their own \\nrules  of  conducting  the  election.  In  that  case,  I  want  to  commend  the  House  Business \\nCommittee (HBC) and your office Hon. Speaker for electing me as the Co-Chair.  \\n \\nMatters  of  the  region  are  very  pertinent  to  this  Community.  Once  this  election  is \\nconcluded, I urge this House to integrate with EALA. Many times we do serious business in \\nEALA such as the audit report. We do serious transactions there but we are not able to connect \\nwith  Parliaments in  partner States. Unlike other  countries like Uganda  and Kenya,  you will \\nfind an audit report has been tabled in the House and we have made serious recommendations. \\nA Member of this region or from Kenya for example was handling a certain institution like\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\nThat Member who is named and shamed and is supposed to take responsibility is appointed in \\nour partner State or even in Kenya to handle another very serious institution. This is because \\nthere is no linkage between EALA and the parliaments particularly in Kenya. So, with that I \\nsupport.  \\n \\nI know the process. We are headed to the fourth pillar of regional integration, just to \\nmention we are already with Custom Union, Common Market and we are almost handling the \\nMonetary Union. I want to inform the Members (although they may be aware) that we shall \\nsoon  have  one  currency  in  the  whole  region  of  East  Africa.  We  shall  not  have  Tanzania  or \\nUganda Shillings but a common currency. As Kenya, we are lobbying to have the Central Bank \\nof East Africa here in Kenya. So, these are matters of our interest as leaders or representatives \\nof the people. \\n \\nFinally, the fourth pillar is the political federation where we aspire to have one nation \\nin the whole region. For that reason, I want to urge Members as I conclude that as we do the \\nelection,  let  us  find  people  of  quality  who  can  transact  and  take  care  of  the  interests  of  our \\ncountry.  Kenya  has  been  accused  many  times,  Members  and  Hon.  Speaker,  to  be  the  only \\ncountry that sweeps the whole nine Members and brings in other nine new Members. As you \\nare aware, four of us are already elected in this House: Hon. Jematiah, Hon. Aburi, Hon. Oburu \\nin  the  Senate  and  myself.  Kenya  is  known  to  sweep  the  nine  Members  and  we  leave  no \\ninstitutional memory. If you look at Uganda and all other nations, you will find they leave 50 \\nper cent of Members. At least for this election let us leave a Member or two for institutional \\nmemory so that our interests are also taken care of. \\n \\nyou for appointing me. \\nHon. Speaker: Let us have the Member for Bondo, Dr. Ochanda.  \\n \\nHon. Gideon Ochanda (Bondo, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. As we discussed \\n \\nthe whole issue of placing our Members to EALA, I think there are one or two things that I \\n\\n With that, I thank you and I am humbled to be elected to chair this Committee. Thank \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Speaker, EALA is a parliament and in Arusha we also have the Secretariat of the \\nCommunity.  Apparently,  that  Community  executes  and  implements  a  lot  of  projects.  A  lot \\nmore of those projects are funded not from the Community but from outside. The point I am \\ntrying  to  bring  here  is  that  these  projects  apparently  are  executed  in  the  national  or  in  the \\nindividual  countries.  For  instance,  in  Kenya  we  have  had  many  of  the  projects  that  are \\ncommunity projects. They are implemented in Kenya but the implementation is done by our \\nown Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) that we have.  \\n \\nIn the end Hon. Speaker,  you will realise that in  this House when we are coming to \\nCommittees, they only do the oversight role. Yet these projects that are implemented by the \\nEALA are hardly overseen by any of our Committees. Meaning that they go without oversight. \\nOn the other hand, EALA does not oversee them because the projects have been implemented \\nin individual countries. This is something that I want to believe that our House, this Parliament \\nand particularly your Chair, Hon. Speaker must get into. They invest quite a  lot of money that \\nis passed by the Community and all these projects are not overseen by any agency.  The EALA \\ndoes not oversee them, neither do our committees here in the House. There was a project that \\nwas in  Lake  Victoria  for purposes of removing  water hyacinth. That  thing is  moribund and \\nnobody can oversee it. \\n \\nThere  was  a  big  project  of  reforestation  that  was  being  done  by  our  Ministry  of \\nEnvironment; nobody oversaw that. There was another project in Kisii and parts of Bomet for \\nwater; large water projects that were being funded through the East African Community which \\nsuffered the same fate for lack of oversight.  The EALA cannot oversee them because they are \\nin  individual  countries.  On  the  other  hand,  we  cannot  oversee  them  because  the  source  of \\nfunding is from the secretariat in Arusha.  \\n\\nThe other thing I wanted to bring out is that EALA stands as the institution that we see \\nin  the  Community,  particularly  in  the  region.  However,  the  biggest  problem  we  have  is  the \\namounts of conflict we have across the individual countries and a lot of disharmony that we \\nhave,  many  times  between  Tanzania  and  Kenya  and  between  Uganda  and  Kenya.  Hardly  a \\nweek passes without having issues or incidences across Lake Victoria or Isebania in Migori. \\nLast week there were major issues because Kenya had not done certain things that on the hand \\nTanzania had done. Transport lorries were being cleared on the Tanzanian side but not on the \\nKenyan side. \\n \\nHon. Speaker as we look through this thing of EALA, we should not just look at it for \\npurposes of the East African Legislative Assembly constantly looking at the laws and the Bills \\nthat we have passed as part of the agenda. We need to have the agenda as part of these problems \\nwhich are the real issues hampering the effort of integration. Those are two critical things that \\nI wanted to bring around as we move towards electing our Members to EALA.  \\n\\nI thank you, Hon. Speaker.  \\nHon.  Speaker:  Thank  you  Hon.  Member  for  Bondo.  Let  us  have  the  Member  for \\n\\n \\nTigania East, Mpuru Aburi. \\nHon. Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East, NOPEU): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me \\n \\nthis opportunity to make my contribution. Let me begin by congratulating the President for the \\nmany issues which he said his Government will focus on in the next five years. One key issue \\ntouching my heart is that of pursuing transformation agenda which will include an overhaul of \\nthe security infrastructure in the country to make it more inclusive. Many Kenyans are facing \\nserious socio-economic hardships since the economic model we have has created a huge gap \\nbetween the poor and the rich. As we speak now, most parts of the country are facing starvation \\nand hunger due to prolonged drought. Two weeks ago\\xe2\\x80\\xa6. \\n \\n\\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): On a point of order, Hon.

Speaker: Yes please! There is a point of order from the Leader of the Majority \\n\\n \\nParty. \\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. I do not want \\n \\nto interrupt my good friend Hon. Mpuru Aburi who is doing his third term. To begin with he \\nshould know that when I stand on a point of order, he should take his seat.  \\n\\nHon. Speaker: You will not be allowed. You will only debate the Motion but do not \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Member for Tigania East, you are an old Member of the House. The \\n\\nHon. Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East, NOPEU): Of course, I am an old Member of this \\n\\nHon. Mpuru is not helping our new Members. It is understandable when a new Member \\nreads  notes,  but  not  a  Member  who  is  serving  his  third  term  and  having  served  in  EALA \\nstanding in his place to read notes, which we do not know are from who or where. I think he is \\ncompletely  out  of  order  and  misleading  our  new  Members.  He  must  not  be  allowed  to  be \\nreading notes, unless he makes disclosure about the author of those notes. \\n \\nrules prohibit any Member from reading\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n \\nHouse but allow me to read the statement because it is mine. \\n \\nread a rehearsed speech which is not part of the debate. \\n \\nhand because I stayed there for five years. \\nHon. Speaker: That is correct. \\n \\nHon. Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East, NOPEU): I want to say we have to support each \\n \\nother. There is no need of hating each other in this Parliament. Sometimes when the Leader of \\nthe Majority Party sees someone speaking, he says: \\xe2\\x80\\x98this man is not allowed to speak in this \\nParliament  because  he  has  stayed  here  for  three  terms.\\xe2\\x80\\x99  I  want  to  tell  him  he  is  very  lucky \\nbecause he got appointed. Do not forget we supported Azimio, and this time I am the Party \\nLeader of National Ordinary People Empowerment Union (NOPEU) Party and as I speak right \\nnow, we are supporting His Excellency the President of this country. \\n \\n \\n\\nHon. Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East, NOPEU): Yes, no problem I know EALA has my \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Member, are you done? Thank you. Hon. Robert Mbui. \\n \\nHon. Robert Mbui (Kathiani, WDM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for the opportunity \\n \\nto also contribute. I am surprised that one of our very close Members has just defected on the \\nFloor of the House, Hon. Mpuru Aburi. Yet, he was supporting us and fighting very strongly \\non our side. \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\nHon Speaker: Order, Hon. Members! Order! Order, Robert Mbui! Honestly, as your \\n \\nSpeaker I want to follow the debate. We can only do so if the conversations are in lower tones \\nthan  they  are  now.  The  East  African  Community  (EAC)  is  the  centre  piece  of  many  of  our \\nhearts. This is a very important Motion. I want to encourage that the quality of people you will \\nelect to EALA, must also be commensurate with the status of Kenya\\xe2\\x80\\x99s region super power. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nHon. Robert Mbui (Kathiani, WDM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. First, I want to begin \\n \\nby supporting what Hon. Wanjiku Muhia has raised. This is a matter of Kenya being the only \\ncountry which clearly removes every Member elected to EALA and elects new ones. I wanted \\nto say, for purposes\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n \\n\\nHon. Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East, NOPEU): On a point of order, Hon. Speaker. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Speaker: There is a point of order from Hon. Mpuru. Can you give the Member \\n \\nfor  Tigania  East  the  microphone?    Hon.  Mpuru  put  your  card  in  and  press  the  intervention \\nbutton so I can give you the microphone. Hon. Aburi you may sit down and let Hon. Robert \\nMbui to continue. \\nHon.  Robert  Mbui  (Kathiani,  WDM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker.  It  looks  like \\n \\ntechnology is not in favour of my colleague so please, allow me to continue. He only wants to \\ncomplain because of a comment he made and I made reference to it. He said he was in Azimio \\nand now he is supporting His Excellency the President. So, he seems to have defected on the \\nFloor. If that is the issue, I think it is not that serious.  \\n \\nI  am  supporting  what  Hon.  Wanjiku  Muhia  has  said  about  maintaining  some  of  our \\nMembers. Hon. Speaker, following what you have said, that we need to have quality Members, \\nI  want  to  propose  when  we  start  discussing  those  Members  going  to  EALA,  we  have  good \\nquality people. We should have one for the institutional memory and people of quality. People \\nwith  degrees  in  Law  or  International  Relations  will  have  an  added  advantage.  Our  Wiper \\nnominee is one such person, Hon. Kennedy Kalonzo Musyoka, who is already in EALA. \\n \\n I want to mention two things about EALA which I think are important for Members to \\nknow.  First,  is  the  issue  of  partner  state  payments.  In  the  11th  Parliament,  I  was  in  the \\nCommittee on Regional Integration. We realised that many partner states do not  make their \\ncontributions for the Community to exist. As we send Members there, this is one of the issues \\npeople need to address. \\n \\nFinally, the Members of EALA who are here have not said this; that another problem \\nthey have is they have no place to call home when they come back to the country. The Members \\nof EALA fall under a Ministry, I think the Ministry of East African Community, yet these are \\nelected Members of Parliament. It is important we find a way so they can also be catered for \\nunder the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC). As they go there and come back, they are \\npart and parcel of the leadership of this nation because they are Members of Parliament. \\nHon. Speaker, with those few remarks, thank you and I support. \\n \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Member for Kanduyi. \\n \\nHon. John Makali (Kanduyi, FORD-K): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for granting me \\n \\nthis opportunity to address this House for the first time. It has been a long wait in the queue but \\nat least my time has come.  \\n\\nBefore I make my contribution to the Motion on the Floor of the House, let me take this \\nopportunity to thank the great people of Kanduyi for having elected me as their representative \\nin this Parliament. It was a long journey and not a walk in the park. I must say I relied on the \\nsupport of many Members of Parliament who came out to campaign for me together will all \\nthe Kanduyi people.  So, I say a big thank you.  \\n\\nHon. Speaker, at this juncture I must thank you most sincerely for being my mentor, \\nteacher and party leader and for the role you played in getting me to this august House. It was \\nnot an easy assignment to remove my predecessor who had served in this House for four terms; \\n20 years and the party leader of Democratic Action Party-Kenya (DAP-K). I must thank the \\npeople of Kanduyi for the favour they granted me to represent them in this House. \\n \\nTurning to the Motion before the House, we appreciate the role of EAC in development \\nmatters in this region. The EAC is a critical component in fostering international trade, regional \\ncooperation and issues touching on cross-border trade. I must say that the names that have been \\ngiven here will play a leading role in selecting Members who will be at EALA. I had occasion \\nto  visit  EALA,  and  I  will  say  without  contradiction  that  our  Members  who  were  there \\npreviously  did  not  reflect  critically  the  quality  of  Kenyans  who  are  representing  us  in  that \\nAssembly.  \\n\\nHon. Charity Chepkwony (Njoro, UDA): On a point of order, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: He is making his Maiden Speech. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c13th October 2022                       NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                               10 \\n\\nHon. John Makali (Kanduyi, FORD-K): Having sat in that Assembly, I was worried \\nabout the people representing this country. I hope the Committee that has been put in place, as \\nhas been said by Members who have contributed before me, will be able to measure up to the \\nassignments that they will have and be able to reflect the true face of Kenya as they take up the \\nassignments in that Assembly. \\n\\n I wish to reiterate, as I join this Assembly, that we must work as a team so as to deliver \\non the agenda  for Kenyans. The agenda for  Kenyans is  basically  fighting  to  ensure that  we \\nreduce  the  cost  of  living  to  ensure  that  our  children  go  to  school,  our  mama  mbogas  and \\nbodabodas are able to earn a living. To this, I will support the Kenya Kwanza agenda that is \\ntowards ensuring that we establish the Hustler Fund that will be able to assist the mama mbogas \\nand the youth of this country to develop themselves and move up. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, I wish to reiterate that, as I come to the Floor of this House, three critical \\nissues  are  important  for  the  people  of  Kanduyi.  I  will  start  with  the  issue  of  Nzoia  Sugar \\nCompany. As we speak, the farmers have not been paid. There is no board of management at \\nNzoia Sugar from the year 2019. The sugarcane is rotting in farmer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s farms and their children \\nare not going to school. I will want the Head of State to do as he assured the people of Kanduyi \\nduring  the  campaigns  that  Nzoia  Sugar  Company  is  going  to  function  and  its  problems  are \\ngoing to be solved so that the people can have value for their sweat. \\n\\nWhen we move around Kanduyi Constituency, we have not been able to benefit from \\nthe last mile supply of electricity. As it was stated in the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, we would be able \\nnot  only  to  ensure  that  electricity  reaches  each  and  every  corner  of  Kanduyi,  but  also  have \\naffordable  electricity  available  to  all  residents  of  Kanduyi  who  have  had  a  lot  of  faith  by \\nelecting me in this House. \\n\\nWe have heard from the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech that the issue of the National Government-\\nConstituencies  Development  Fund  (NG-CDF)  is  a  critical  Fund  that  has  helped  many  other \\npeople in our constituencies. I will be at the forefront to ensure that we team up with all the \\nother Members of this House to ensure that we ring-fence the CDF so that it assists our people \\nthe way it is expected to. \\n \\nI wish to state that a healthy nation is a wealthy nation. At this juncture, we would want \\nto ensure that the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) takes off and we ring-fence it from \\nany other assaults that were there by people who are siphoning funds from it. We must ensure \\nthat universal healthcare comes to fruition. \\n \\nFinally, Hon. Speaker, I wish to finish my remarks by stating the words of Henry Ford \\nthat  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccoming  together  is  a  beginning,  working  together  is  progress,  and  keeping  together  is \\nsuccess.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In the prayer that we state here every day when we come to this House, we exist for \\nthe welfare of society and the just government of the people. We hope that we will be able to \\nrise to the occasion to ensure that we fulfil the promises made up to our people.  \\n\\nThank you, and I support. \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Member for Njoro, Hon Kathambi Chepkwony. \\nHon.  Charity Chepkwony (Njoro, UDA):  Thank  you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me \\nthis  opportunity.    Let  me  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  you  as  our  Speaker,  and  our \\nDeputy Speaker, our lady. I also thank every Kenyan for voting for our able President, William \\nSamoei Ruto. I also thank my people of Njoro Constituency for re-electing me as their Member \\nof Parliament. \\n\\nI stand to support the list. I wish to take a short time. Thank you. \\nHon. Speaker: That is all? Before Hon.

The reason being, right now one of the biggest issues, \\nwhen you look at some of the things that the EALA has been on is that, they face difficulties \\nin terms of ensuring that they have policies in place that cut across all our countries because \\nthe frameworks put in place are not usually very comprehensive. Mine is just to urge both sides \\nof  the  House  to  ensure  that  they  bring  Members  on  board  who  have  the  prerequisite \\nqualifications  so  that  we  do  not  have  Members  who  just  go  there  and  tick  boxes  instead  of \\ndoing the actual work.  \\n\\nI submit. Thank you. \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Member for Kamukunji. \\nHon. Yusuf Hassan (Kamukunji, JP): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for the opportunity. \\nSince it is my first time to speak in the 13th Parliament, I want to thank the wonderful people \\nof Kamukunji for bringing me to this august House. I want to pledge, as I have done before, to \\nwork for them humbly, respectfully and even harder for them in this Parliament. \\n\\nSpeaking  on  the  issue  of  EALA,  I  want  to  put  this  particular  issue  in  the  global, \\ninternational  and  regional  context  of  the  geopolitics  of  our  country.  The  East  African \\ncommunity is one of the most important regional institutions and perhaps one with the biggest \\npotential  in  bringing  together  the  people  of  the  region  not  only  in  terms  of  economic \\ncorporation but also eventually the main vision of the East African people to have East African \\npolitical federation. Knowing that in fact East Africa is our biggest trending partner and our \\nbiggest political allies and EALA has been an Assembly that legislates the laws of this region, \\nit is very important that we send the best minds that we have in this country.  I must say that \\nduring past elections of Members to EALA, unfortunately, the case has always been to push \\npeople who have been rejected politically, and to use the EALA as a garbage dump to get rid \\nof people who perhaps have not been selected for leadership positions in the country. \\n\\nThe EALA Members are the face of Kenya. We must send our best minds to push the \\nvision, mission and aspirations of East Africans.  If we send someone who has no clue other \\nthan the fact that they have been given a position of payment and privilege, we will be failing \\nin that objective.  \\n\\n I urge this House and the leadership of political parties and the country, to take this \\nmatter very seriously and send our best minds to represent us in the East African region, which \\nis a building block for the bigger vision of a united Africa that can play its role on the global \\narena. This is so that Africa can take its place in international politics, be heard as a continent, \\nand become players on the global stage.   \\n\\nThe EALA is just the beginning. It is the first step for us to assert the fact that we want \\na stronger economic and political East Africa. We then go to the African Union where we have \\na new trade agreement for the whole of Africa. The EALA will play an important role in that. \\nThat is why we should be very serious with regards to the people that we send there. It is not \\njust a job for the boys and girls. It is a job for people who can push us forward, put our name \\nup there and develop laws and legislation that will lift up the East African region, make it a \\nregional power in Africa and a major player in global affairs. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker:  Thank you. I will give an opportunity to Hon. Andrew Okuome. \\nHon. Adipo Okuome (Karachuonyo, ODM):  Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me \\n\\nthe opportunity.  \\n\\nThe  EALA  is  a  very  important  institution  for  member-States.  I  recall  when  the \\nmembership  only  covered  three  countries.  I  also  recall  when  Kenya  was  getting  its \\nIndependence and the East African Community was the hope of the three countries becoming \\na federation. That has disappeared into thin air, which is very disappointing. Because of this, I \\nwish that we elect people who can unite the whole of East Africa. All we see today is conflict. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It has been the cause of some of the \\nconflicts we have had with Uganda and Tanzania.   \\n\\nDo you remember Migingo Island? There are wars there most of the time. Some people \\ncome from Uganda, arrest our people, take them to Uganda and whatever they do with them, \\nonly God knows. We want people who can really look at the problems that we have as East \\nAfrican Community States and find a solution.  \\n\\nWe also need people who can unite us commercially. I heard our President speaking \\nwhen he met with his counterpart in Tanzania. He was crying for commercial unity in trade \\nand the East African currency that we used to have before the formation of the East African \\nCommunity (EAC).  Probably, that is one of the things that the current Community should fight \\nfor, so that we have one currency. That is what will also help us to ensure that trade in East \\nAfrican Community States is viable and that we have the East African Community of our hopes \\nand dreams, one that can move us from where we are and help us all in terms of trade and more \\nimportantly, politically.  \\n\\n We would like political unity. That is what I referred to earlier when I talked of the \\nfederation. When we have political unity, there are many other good things that we can achieve.  \\nWe can achieve so much if we are united.  I wholly believe that we will give our partners very \\nable Members to serve us in the EALA. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity. I hope that my dream will be \\n\\nkept alive by those who will go to the EALA. \\n\\nHon. Speaker:  Let us have the Member for Gilgil. \\nHon. Martha Wangari (Gilgil, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. I also rise to support \\nthe nomination of these Members. This list is very well-thought-out. They know that they have \\ntheir work cut out for them in terms of the issues being raised at the EALA. Those who go there \\nmust know that they have to defend the position that Kenya holds in terms of our bilateral and \\nmultilateral relations in Africa and East Africa, specifically. I hope that the team will also look \\nat all matters as stipulated, in terms of balance and even getting new blood. Even as we make \\ndo with institutional memory, I hope that we also get new blood to take new ideas to the EALA.   \\n\\nHon. Speaker, EALA member-states should address the disputes that they have with \\ntheir  neighbours.  Let  us  deal  with  issues  of  Migingo,  trade  imbalances  between  us  and \\nTanzania,  herders,  maize  and  Maasais  across  the  two  countries.  We  have  had  issues  with \\nTanzania. I hope that these Members will defend the integrity of the boundaries of this country \\nand the position that Kenya holds. They hold the aspirations of all Kenyans. We should not \\nalways give in and become the underdog. I hope we can reclaim the position that Kenya holds \\nin the EALA and the EAC. \\n\\n  With those few remarks, I support the appointment of the Joint Committee. I hope that \\n\\nthis work will be expedited, so that we are able to deal with the timelines at the right time.   \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker:  Thank you. Let us have the Member for Kesses. Where is he? He is \\nnot here.  Let me give an opportunity to the Member for Malava who was soliciting for a chance \\nto speak. \\n\\nHon. Malulu Injendi (Malava, ANC): Thank you, Hon. Speaker.  I also rise to support \\nthe Committee members. I urge them to develop regulations that will guide the House when it \\ncomes to electing these persons.  \\n\\nI  recall  that  in  the  last  Parliament,  we  talked  of  regional  representation,  gender,  et \\ncetera. In the last Parliament, we voted for three persons from one community to the EALA. \\nWe almost voted for a fourth one were it not for an intervention indicating that we did not have \\ngender representation. I urge Hon. Wanjiku Muhia, who is very familiar with the case, to help \\nthis Parliament ensure that the persons we vote in represent the regional representation of the \\ncountry. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I \\nrecall  that  sometime  in  the  last  Parliament,  the  then  President  of  Tanzania,  the  late  Hon. \\nMagufuli, burnt 5, 000 of our chicks alive. I did not hear our representatives in EALA talking \\nabout  it.  He  took  away  1,000  cattle  from  us,  but  I  did  not  hear  any  voice  from  our \\nrepresentatives.  As  Hon.  Mbui  said,  we  need  to  elect  people  who  can  really  represent  our \\ninterests and speak about the ills affecting Kenyans. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. I support the appointment of the Members. \\nHon. Speaker: Thank you. Member for Bomachoge Borabu. \\nHon.  Nolfason  Barongo  (Bomachoge  Borabu,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker.  I \\nhave been looking forward to this particular address; it is the first one. I would like to support \\nthe appointment of the ad hoc Committee on election of Members to EALA. \\n\\nI thank God for the miracle of my election to this House. I am Hon. Nolfason Obadiah \\nBarongo, Member of Parliament for Bomachoge Borabu. My journey to this House is the stuff \\nof  dreams.  I  was  a  vegetable  vendor  before.  Now,  by  the  grace  of  God,  I  am  a  Member  of \\nParliament. It is a humbling and inspiring story for another day.  \\n\\nLike many Members who have spoken before me, I would like to congratulate you and \\nyour deputy on being elected the heads of this Assembly. I pray God to grant you good health \\nand wisdom as you lead us in the making of a better country. Allow me to profusely thank the \\npeople of Boochi, Bombamba, Magenche and Bokimonge wards for putting aside clanism and \\ncharting  a  new  path  of  unity  for  Bomachoge  Borabu;  and  they  did  so  emphatically  and \\npeacefully. I promise that I will serve them with diligence and humility. Let me also single out \\nmy  wife  and  children,  my  mother  and  father,  siblings  and  relatives,  many  friends  and  my \\ncampaign team full of young dreamers for pulling a memorable victory in this election. I thank \\nthe ODM party and my party leader, Hon. Raila Amolo Odinga, for issuing me with the ticket \\nthat helped me to be elected to this House. I cannot forget my worthy opponents, who did not \\npetition my election. To all of them, I would like to say thank you very much. \\n\\nYou may know that Bomachoge Borabu is one of the two Bomachoge constituencies \\nin Kisii County. The other being Bomachoge Chache represented by my brother Hon. Alfah \\nMiruka.  My  constituency  has  experienced  tribal  clashes  in  the  past  because  we  border  the \\nMaasai. Thankfully, peace has prevailed lately and business has been booming.  \\n\\nMy constituency boasts of a school called Riokindo High School. In last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Kenya \\nCertificate of Secondary Education (KCSE), a staggering 476 out of 485 scored C+ (plus) and \\nabove. Allow me to praise the headteacher, the staff, the community and, most importantly, the \\nstudents  for the excellent  results.  I had the opportunity of touring my  constituency over the \\nweekend. Some schools could be improved. A case in point is a school called Riabu, which has \\nbeen  a  beacon  of  education  in  my  constituency  for  a  long  time.  It  is  unthinkable  that  the \\nNational Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF) will not be available to \\nrescue such schools as Riabu that truly need much improvement. I will champion the elevation \\nof Kenyenya Polytechnic to a national polytechnic and the construction of Gesabakwa Institute, \\nso that students who cannot make it to university can pursue their careers there. \\n\\nIn the interest of time, I would like to sign off by saying how privileged I am to be the \\nrepresentative of the good people of Bomachoge Borabu and Kenyans at large. I hope that the \\ndiscussions we have here will be geared towards bettering the lives of our people.  \\n\\nThank you very much, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Owen Baya (Kilifi North, UDA): Thank you very much, Hon Speaker. First, I \\nwould like to support the appointment of the Committee and congratulate the proposed Co-\\nChair and all Members on being nominated to the Committee. \\n\\nHon.

Unless you anticipate to speak to the next Motion, you may decongest the screen \\nto help us in managing the queue. \\n\\nHon. Owen Baya (Kilifi North, UDA): I was congratulating the Committee.  We are \\nhonoured  as  a  country  today  to  host  the  Secretary-General  of  the  East  African  Community \\n(EAC), Mr. Peter Mathuki, who is also Kenyan. He is in the country with the Chief Justice of \\nthe East African Court of Justice (EACJ). \\n\\nAs this Committee gets down to work, there are very many important things that they \\nneed to do. We need to send a strong delegation to EALA. One onerous task of this Committee \\nis to ensure that they put together criteria that gives us the best.  \\n\\nI  acknowledge  what  my  brother  Hon.  Mbui  has  said  on  the  need  for  continuity  in \\nEALA. It is sad that this is the only country that sweeps everybody out and brings in a new \\nteam. When we get there as a country, we are disadvantaged because we have to start on a fresh \\npage. It is important that we retain one or two people in EALA. I do not want to campaign for \\nanyone, but it is very important that we retain some of them. I want to reiterate that we need to \\nsend quality representation to EALA. I think we had good representation in this Assembly and \\nwe look forward to having better and quality representation. When campaigns for EALA start, \\nit is a very exciting time. I want to urge new Members to stay in the lobby when the campaigns \\nstart. It is a very interesting time. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Order, Hon. Members. There is a point of order from Hon. Wangwe. \\nHon.  Emmanuel  Wangwe  (Navakholo,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker.  I  do  not \\nwant  to  interrupt  my  colleague  and  good  friend  the  Deputy  Majority  Leader.  I  rise  under \\nStanding  Order  83  as  read  together  with  Standing  Order  95.  Listening  to  Members\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\ncontributions to this Motion and considering the importance of the next order, I move that the \\nMover be called upon to reply so that we move to the next order. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Thank you, Hon. Wangwe. I see quite a bit of interest on this Motion. \\nAfter Hon. Baya, I will give opportunity to three Members on either side then call the Mover \\nto reply. Members have been doing very well in terms of time; nobody has spoken for more \\nthan five minutes, which is very good. \\n\\nHon. Owen Baya (Kilifi North, UDA): I was telling new Members to stay in the lobby \\nto  listen  to  the  people  campaigning  so  that  we  elect  people  who  can  provide  quality \\nrepresentation.  Please  engage  them  well  as  they  campaign.  There  will  be  very  intense \\ncampaigns at the lobby. Please stay there so that we elect people of very good qualities. \\n\\nI want to ask the team that is going to do this job to do a good job for us as a country. \\nGive this country honour by ensuring that we elect people that deserve to be in that Assembly, \\nnot  just  because  your  party  has  said  that  you  must  be  elected.  This  House  must  make  the \\ndecision.  I  remember  during  the  last  EALA  election  it  was  about  what  a  party  had  said, \\nirrespective  of  whether  the  candidate  was  qualified  or  not.  The  party  said  and  followed  the \\nparty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  decision.  This  time  round  we  need  to  scrutinise  everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  curriculum  vitae  and \\nconsider the qualification of persons we are electing.  It  is  about  the  country.  It  is  not  about \\nparty or individuals. That is why this Committee is a joint Committee of the many parties. Let \\nus not look at which party is proposing who. Let us look at the quality of the persons. Most \\nimportantly, listen to the candidates when they come to campaign. I wish those who will come \\nto campaign well. I wish the Committee well as they do their job.  \\n\\nI thank you, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Oyula. \\nHon.  Joseph  Oyula  (Butula,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker,  for  giving  me  this \\n\\nopportunity to also contribute to this Motion. \\n\\n Hon.  Speaker,  let  me  start  by  congratulating  you  and  your  Deputy  for  having  been \\nelected to lead this House.  I also want to thank the people of Butula for giving me a second \\nchance to represent them in this House. Butula has been unfortunate in the past in that one is \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

This time, they gave me a second chance.  I sincerely thank them \\nand assure them that I will work with them very closely. \\n\\nAs for this Motion, I support the Committee that has been appointed. However, we need \\nto  make  sure  that  the  people  we  appoint  to  the  EALA  are  qualified  and  can  represent  our \\ncountry very well, particularly in trade between our country and the other partners.  The quality \\nof the people we appoint to EALA must be above board.  We need to make sure that Kenya is \\nwell represented and that Kenya appoints people who are going to lead the Community into \\nworking together for the benefit of the people of East Africa. \\n\\nThose of us who live along the Ugandan border know what it means to be together with \\nour  neighbours.    If  our  neighbours  are  not  cooperative,  we  might  not  have  peace  along  our \\nborders.  Because of bad blood, you can have people fighting over very small issues.  So, let \\nus have good representatives at EALA.  \\n\\nWith those few remarks, I thank you once more for giving me this opportunity and I \\n\\nthank the people of Butula for electing me for a second term. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Johana Ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99eno. Give him the microphone. \\nHon. Johana Kipyegon (Emurua Dikirr, UDA): Thank you very much, Hon. Speaker \\nfor giving me this opportunity to also ventilate on this issue on EALA.  From the outset, I have \\nno issue with the Select  Committee which is going to pick the Members. As my colleagues \\nhave discussed, we need to get serious about EALA.  There are many issues which need to be \\nventilated in that Assembly yet we seem to take it for granted.  That is why we have not made \\nany serious progress on the question of having one united East Africa, or having one leadership.  \\nThe people in that Assembly may not be taking up serious matters. We have many issues to \\nlook at, for example, cross-border clashes and the East African market.  If we could trade freely \\nwithin East Africa, we would make serious progress.   \\n\\nIn  my  opinion,  if  you  look  at  the  composition  of  this  House,  we  have  fairly  young \\npeople.  When you look at the Senate, we also have middle aged people. My thought is that we \\nshould  send  the  older  generation  to  EALA,  especially  people  who  have  contested  for \\npresidency, so that they can go and debate heavy matters that touch on East Africa.  People like \\nWajackoyah should be sent there.  I am expecting to see the likes of Wajackoyah, Hon. Kalonzo \\nMusyoka, Hon. Raila Odinga and Hon. Gideon  Moi  in  that list.   Instead of leaving them to \\nroam around the country and disrupting our leadership, why can we not send them to EALA, \\nso that they can debate on serious matters affecting the East African countries? My suggestion \\nto  the  parties  that  will  pick  the  individuals  is  that  they  should  consider  these  people.    The \\nOrange  Democratic  Movement  (ODM)  should  bring  to  us  Hon.  Raila  Odinga.  The  Wiper \\nDemocratic  Movement  should  bring  to  us  Hon.  Kalonzo  Musyoka  and  the  Kenya  African \\nNational Union (KANU) should bring to us Hon. Gideon Moi.  We from Kenya Kwanza, might \\nlook for His Excellency Uhuru Kenyatta if he wishes to be on the list.  \\n\\nAn Hon. Member: No! He is in Jubilee Party. \\nHon.  Johana  Kipyegon  (Emurua  Dikirr,  UDA):  So,  Jubilee  should  bring  us  Uhuru \\nKenyatta.  We do not want these great Statesmen roaming around the country and troubling \\nour  President.    They  should  be  in  EALA  debating  matters  that  affect  the  East  African \\nCommunity. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, that is my submission and I am looking forward to that day we will vet \\n\\nthose Members in this House. Thank you. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Member for Taveta. Where is he?  Did he login and leave? There you \\n\\nare. \\n\\nHon. John Bwire  (Taveta, WDM):  Thank  you,  Hon. Speaker for the opportunity to \\naddress you again.  I want to contribute to the Motion and agree with my colleagues who have \\nstated  earlier  that  we  need  competent  people  who  will  address  multilateral  and  bilateral \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I  recommend candidates who come  from  border towns like Taveta  and \\nBusia to be considered in those positions. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Omboko, Milemba. \\nHon. Omboko Milemba (Emuhaya, ANC): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. I was among \\nthe first people here. Thank you for the opportunity you have given me to contribute on this \\nmatter. \\n\\nLet me begin by congratulating and supporting the list of Members in that Committee.  \\nThe list is solid and, at least, I see two people with the Chief of the Order of the Burning Spear \\n(CBS) title.  I also see Hon. Muhia who has served in that Assembly before, who will also be \\none of the co-chairpersons.  \\n\\nThe East African Community is a very old institution.  The old Assembly left several \\nmarks  in  Kenya  including  parts  of  Upper  Hill  that  we  refer  to  as  Community.    The  new \\nAssembly  which  began  in  1999  and  was  actualised  in  2000  established  the  Legislative \\nAssembly under Article 9 of the Assembly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Constitution.  This is an important institution for \\nour  regional  coordination,  especially  on  matters  culture,  trade,  economy,  and  politics. \\nTherefore, I am looking forward to this Committee vetting and bringing us names that really \\nqualify to sit in the Assembly. \\nThe other thing that Members have mentioned here is the fact that we need qualified \\n \\nand esteemed people to represent us in EALA.  The Member for Emurua Dikirr, who has just \\nspoken before me, sought to find highly qualified people. He was just yearning to find high \\nquality people who can command certain respect within the East African Community so that \\nthey can be felt heavily when they walk, speak, refer to matters about Kenya and represent us. \\nHe may not have necessarily just been speaking about the old guards who were in the elections \\nrecently. What is the stature of the man we are taking to the East African Legislative Assembly, \\nso that when he walks around, he is an ambassador of some sort who is actually representing \\nthe  Kenyan  interests?  By  his  looks,  exposure,  and  experience,  he  is  just  enough  to  make \\nrepresentation better. Therefore, I ask this Committee to do its work very well. When it comes \\nto the elections, we will vet these people and take very high quality people to the Assembly.  \\nThe East African Community, and EALA in particular, is so important because there \\n \\nare many matters that affect us. Let me deal with the positive ones because whenever we talk \\nabout this Assembly, we tend to deal with conflicts. We need trade between Kenya and Uganda. \\nUganda has been one of our leading trader partners until Britain took over. We need Tanzania \\nbecause of the plenty of cereals there. We need other products from Congo that is now part of \\nthe expanded EALA.  \\n \\nI believe the people who will be elected to this Assembly will be people who can tap \\ngood relations that can improve the movement of goods between the borders, so that we can \\nbenefit from the trade between the East African bloc. We should create an Assembly that will \\nmake  laws  that  will  move  us  towards  even  a  closer  cooperation.  I  heard  about  a  common \\ncurrency. I heard of the issue of removing tariff barriers of trade, particularly between Kenya \\nand Tanzania, where we have many grains. I hear there are 14 trade barriers, which need to be \\nremoved. This will make us have greater cooperation.  \\n \\n\\n[The Speaker (Hon. Moses Wetangula) left the Chair] \\n\\n[The Deputy Speaker (Hon.

Deputy Speaker: Member for Igembe Central, we have one more person.   \\nHon. Daniel Karitho (Igembe Central, JP): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I have really been looking \\nfor this chance to address the House. I am grateful that I got it. May I start by thanking God \\nand the people of Igembe Central for believing in me and trusting in my capacity to lead them \\nas their area Member of Parliament.  I  also  congratulate  you, Hon.  Deputy  Speaker, and the \\nSpeaker himself, for your election. I start by saying that I am grateful to the people of Igembe \\nCentral for believing in  me; the people of Wathiru Ward, Kiran\\xe2\\x80\\x99gondu Njia Ward, Kangeta \\nWard and Igembe East Ward, thank you very much. I will fight very hard to deliver on my \\npromises. I will not let you down.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I come from Igembe Central, a region known for producing what \\nwe internationally refer to as \\xe2\\x80\\x98green gold\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Locally, we call it mairungi, miraa and khat. As we \\ntalk, that industry has been employing more than 500,000 people. Today, as we deliberate on \\nthe team that will be handling our cases at EALA, we should have a team that will represent \\nKenya and represent Kenya\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interests politically, socially, and even economically.  \\nI know Tanzania very well. They have a lot of miraa around Tanga, in Mumbu, and \\n \\nhave not given us a chance to sell our miraa there. Therefore, I expect the team that will be \\npicked to be able to negotiate on behalf of farmers and traders in Meru, so that we can have a \\nchance to sell our \\xe2\\x80\\x98green gold\\xe2\\x80\\x99 there. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker,  Igembe Central  has not  been represented properly.  Electricity \\nconnectivity is about 30 per cent. Not a single kilometre of tarmac has been done for the last \\n10  years.  As  our  President  said  the  other  day,  we  are  giving  subsidy  to  production  and  not \\nconsumption. Right now, there is a strong famine. We expect to see the Government deliver \\nseeds  as  we  look  forward  to  receive  rains  in  October,  so  that  we  in  future,  do  not  go  back \\nlooking for famine relief food. We are receiving famine relief food which is bought at billions \\nof shillings. I believe the harvest would not be at that cost if that money was diverted to bring \\nin seeds. The harvest could not be worth that cost. It would be of great benefit to the people of \\nMeru and Igembe in particular.  \\n \\nWe  have  an  area  called  lower  Igembe  that  is  very  arable.  However,  flowing  water \\nthough rivers seem to have dried. Farmers cannot transport their farm produce to the market \\nbecause of poor road network. If that area is well connected to tarmac, I believe we can feed \\nthe whole of Meru County and Lower Eastern. As we talk of food security, we cannot have \\nfood security in areas where there is no human security. Therefore, if the areas that are prone \\nto insecurity are developed and we have enough police stations, like in Uthini, where there is \\na  fully  packed  police  station,  we  can  have  enough  food  for  ourselves  and  even  assist  other \\ncounties. \\n \\nWe  also  lack  electricity.  Our  education  standards  have  been  going  down  because \\nschools are not connected to electricity yet we are expected to compete against other Kenyans \\nwho have electricity in  their schools.  All  these factors  are bringing our education standards \\ndown. This monster called delocalisation has destroyed our education in Igembe because most \\nof  the  teachers  brought  to  handle  institutions  there  are  foreigners  who  do  not  know  the \\nsituations in the area hence education standards have been going down. We need people who \\ncan understand one another. Although the teachers are Kenyans, we need Kenyans from our \\nregions; Kenyans who know our problems and how to handle our  people. The schools were \\ndoing well before delocalisation. Even the giant schools that were doing wonderfully are now \\ngoing down. Something should be done and I believe it will be done.  \\n \\nteam that is able to negotiate, and represent us to our benefit. \\n\\nAs I wind up, I believe we are going to have a team that will represent us in EALA; a \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity. I thank God and you all.  \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. The last under this Motion will be the Member for \\n \\nManyatta. We still have a chance until 9.00 p.m. Hon. Members, everybody will have a chance \\nto make their maiden speech.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Gitonga. \\nHon. Gitonga Mukunji (Manyatta, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I take \\nthis chance to support the Committee. As many other Members have put it, we need Members \\nthat  understand  our  integrity  and  its  purpose.  The  East  African  Community  has  a  lot  of \\npotential.  We  need  to  strategise  on  how  to  scale  up  our  trade  and  have  common  industries. \\nCurrently, we are importing fertiliser and many other items.  It is possible that the EAC can \\nestablish a factory to manufacture that particular product that is used by all partner States.  \\n\\nWe need to elect Members to EALA in a wise manner. I cannot put my finger on any \\nparticular achievement of the last Assembly at EALA. I even googled to see their contributions, \\nbut there were none. We need to have ways of checking their performance and I am hoping \\nthis Assembly will come up with ideas of ensuring that we hold them accountable. We, unlike \\nthem at EALA, have sufficient checks and balances from our constituents in case we do not \\nperform to their expectations. \\n\\n If it is the President, he has the legislature and the other arms of Government to check \\non him. This is not the case when it comes to EALA. Their main duty is to ensure that they \\ndefend  the  interests  of  Kenya  in  the  Community.  Right  now,  we  have  a  trade  deficit  with \\nTanzania. We need to know how we can balance that. It is up to those Members to ensure that \\nwe achieve that. They must bring in agenda and legislation that is going to help Kenya achieve \\nthat.  \\n\\nWith that, I beg to support the Motion as given by the Leader of the Majority Party. I \\n\\nthank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.             \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Mover to reply.  \\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. Let me \\ntake this opportunity to  thank all the Members who have contributed to  this  Motion. A few \\nissues have been mentioned and I just want to pick from where Hon. Wanjiku Muhia left. She \\nis Member emeritus of EALA. On the issue of continuity, I encourage the Committee to look \\nat the nomination rules and the timelines. When we vote as a House, that is something we need \\nto look into. We do not have to lose everything that happened in the previous Assembly because \\nwe are getting new Members into the Assembly.  \\n\\nI want  to  encourage,  as  my Deputy, Hon.  Owen  Baya, said,  and without seeming to \\ncampaign for anybody, that it is good to have some institutional memory. We had a number of \\nMembers in the previous Assembly who have now joined us. Hon. Mpuru Aburi, Hon. Wanjiku \\nMuhuia, and Hon. Jematiah are here with us. Hon Oburu Odinga is now in the Senate as the \\nSenator for Siaya. We also had Hon. Simon Mbugua, Hon. Abdikadir, Hon. Noor Mohamed, \\nHon. Fatuma Ibrahim and Hon. Kennedy Musyoka. Hon. Abdikadir and Hon. Simon Mbugua \\nhad resigned to run for parliamentary seats. Hon. Kennedy Musyoka, Hon. Noor Mohamed and \\nHon. Fatuma Ibrahim are still there.  When the time comes, if they are interested, we should be \\nable to consider them.  \\n\\nThere is something Hon. Johana Ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99eno mentioned and I do not know if he is still here. \\nIt is good that besides having institutional memory, we should have leaders who have served \\nthe nation. We need nationalists and Statesmen to serve in EALA. I also want to join him to \\nencourage,  especially  the  Orange  Democratic  Movement  and  WIPER-K  to  consider \\nnominating Hon. Kalonzo Musyoka.  \\n\\nI know the son was there, but consider nominating Hon. Kalonzo Musyoka to EALA. \\nThe former Prime Minister, the Right. Hon. Raila Odinga, should also be considered for EALA. \\nSuch  nomination  will  not  only  be  an  honour  to  a  leader  who  has  been  a  Prime  Minister  in \\nKenya, but also dissuade him from what I have seen him trying to do in the recent past, namely, \\nattending the Bunge La Mwananchi forum at Jevanjee Gardens. It is more honourable for Raila \\nOdinga to be attending the East Africa Legislative Assembly other than Bunge La Mwananchi. \\nI am not saying this in any way to belittle Bunge La Mwananchi. It is a good place to engage \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It is  an insult because it is him and His Excellency \\nUhuru Kenyatta who led those boda boda riders to the state of the economy where Kenya is in \\ntoday. \\n\\nI  want  to  encourage  our  brothers  and  sisters  in  ODM  and  their  leadership  to  please \\nconsider nominating Hon. Raila Odinga and Hon. Hon. Kalonzo Musyoka. Beyond EALA, it \\nis probably time, as a House, we started thinking of how to engage our national leaders who \\nlose in national elections. It is time we started thinking how to engage the caliber of leaders \\nlike Hon. Kalonzo Musyoka, His Excellency Uhuru Kenyatta, and Hon. Raila Odinga in our \\nnational  conversations  and  think  of  how  we  would  even  create  the  position  of  Leader  of \\nOpposition that would give them a forum other than seeing the stature of Hon. Raila Odinga \\nwith Hon. Babu Owino and T.J Kajwang in Jevanjee Gardens and the next day in Kariobangi. \\nI hear tomorrow or the following day they will be in Kibra inciting Kenyans.  \\n\\nHon. (Ms.) Odhiambo-Mabona (Suba North, ODM): Inaudible)  \\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Let me tell you, Hon. Millie Odhiambo, \\nyou can shout from your seat, but the issues I am raising are pertinent. I would encourage you, \\nHon. Millie Odhiambo, instead of shouting from your seat to engage with your leader in ODM \\nto know what legislative measures you would bring to this Assembly to deal with the question \\nof food prices in Kenya and the rising cost of living. Because it is not enough to incite Kenyans \\nout there. It is better to use your leadership positions to bring agendas before the House that \\nwill improve the lot. \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon Deputy Speaker, I know Hon. (Dr.) Oundo is shouting for relevance from his seat. \\nI know how it feels to lose an election.  The people that led you to lose that election are now \\nenjoying themselves. For example, the former President Uhuru Kenyatta is enjoying himself \\nin retirement having misled Hon. Raila Odinga into a trap to believe that there was something \\ncalled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeep state\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9csystem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that never existed. \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\nThe  same  Uhuru  Kenyatta  and  his  handshake  brother  are  the  ones  who  took  this \\neconomy to  where it is.  Therefore,  you cannot  pretend to  be crying with  Kenyans. You are \\nactually dancing on the tears of Kenyans whom you led to where they are. It is the State capture \\nthat was perpetuated by  the  handshake brothers and the Government  that has destroyed our \\neconomy  and  country.  You  pretend  now  that  you  will  go  and  incite  Kenyans  in  Jeevanjee \\nGardens, Kariobangi and Mathare. Kenyans are more intelligent than you think. They know \\nthat  you  are  attempting  to  incite  them.  They  are  patient.  They  will  be  patient  to  give  this \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

No amount of \\nshouting will deter us.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I now beg to reply and encourage our colleagues to nominate our \\nemeritus leaders to  EALA.  I want  to  encourage  Hon. Raila Odinga to  apply. Hon. Wanjiku \\nMuhia must consider him and Hon. Kalonzo Musyoka as fairly as possible. \\n \\n \\n\\nWith those remarks, I beg to reply. \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, I wish to recognise the presence of guests and \\n\\nstudents from Gigiri Primary School in Samburu East Constituency, Samburu County. \\n\\n \\nHon. Members, I now wish to put the Question. \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n(Question put and agreed to) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): On a point of order, Hon. Deputy \\n\\nSpeaker. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: What is your point of order, Leader of the Majority Party? \\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Hon. Deputy Speaker, before we move to \\n\\nOrder No.9, I want to move a Procedural Motion. \\n\\nI appreciate that we have very many new Members who have been struggling to catch \\nthe Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye, but they have not contributed. There are even other Members who were re-\\nelected, but they have not had an opportunity to speak. Considering that this is the last day, I \\nwant to move a Procedural Motion to extend sitting time.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPROCEDURAL MOTION \\n\\nEXTENSION OF SITTING TIME \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Hon. Deputy Speaker, I beg to move the \\n\\n \\nfollowing Motion: \\n\\nThat, pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order 33 and notwithstanding the \\nprovisions of Standing  Order 97(1) on  Limitation of Debate on Motions, this  House \\nresolves to extend its Sitting time today, Thursday, 13th October 2022 until 9.00 p.m. \\nThe gist of this Motion is to allow many Members to contribute, as we move to the next \\nMotion which is Order No.9 by Hon. Elsie Muhanda. All our new Members and those who \\nhave not spoken will have an opportunity to contribute before we go on recess. It will be very \\nunfair for a new Member or a Member who has been re-elected to go back home during the \\nrecess without getting the chance to stand in the House where people elected you to come, and \\nat least, thank them on national television. If the House agrees to extend the Sitting today up to \\n9p.m., it will be a good opportunity. If Members manage time and we finish before that time, \\nit will not matter. At least, nobody will be locked out because we have about two and a half \\nhours. If Members contribute for 10 minutes, you can count the number of Members who will \\nspeak. There are very many Members who have not spoken. \\n\\nTherefore, I just wanted to move that Motion and request the House to agree with me \\nto extend the Sitting up to 9.00 p.m. Everybody will have opportunity to speak. As we take our \\nshort recess, you will not be blamed that you came to the House, but you did not speak. It is \\ngood for the new Members to note that if they do not make their impact during the first few \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

They can publish next \\nweek and say that you were elected and you are yet to utter a word after a month. \\n\\nWithout pre-empting debate, this Motion by Hon. Elsie Muhanda is very important. It \\nis on feeding our school children, especially during this drought season. It is a good Motion for \\neverybody to say something. \\n\\nWith those remarks, I want to ask Hon. Kaguchia to second. \\nHon. Kaguchia John (Mukurweini, UDA): Hon. Deputy Speaker, first, I would like to \\ntake  this  opportunity  to  second  the  Motion  which  has  been  proposed  by  the  Leader  of  the \\nMajority Party. It is very important for every new Member and even those who have come back \\nto be given an opportunity to give their maiden speech. \\n\\nI would like to take this opportunity as well to congratulate you and our Speaker for \\nbeing elected in the last elections that we had in this National Assembly for the speakership. I \\nalso  thank  the  people  of  Mukurweini  for  electing  me  as  their  Member  of  Parliament,  and \\nbestowing on me the mandate to take care of their issues in the next five years. As I say this, I \\nunderstand very well that this is just an opportunity that I have been given, not because I was \\nthe  best  in  Mukurweini,  but  because  the  people  of  Mukurweini  saw  it  fit  to  believe  in  the \\npromises and hope that we gave them. I promise that I will be very keen to ensure that we fulfill \\nwhat we promised them as much as possible.  \\n\\nI  also  want  to  thank my  family who stood with  me during this time.  I would  like to \\nrecognise the late Richard Kaguchia, my father, who unfortunately passed on about 10 months \\nbefore I was elected as a Member of Parliament. He would have been very happy to see me \\nhere. I would like to promise the people of Mukurweini that I am going to represent them and \\nI am going to be their voice. I am going to be fearless and will stand by what they want us to \\ndo. I am particularly keen on developing the infrastructure of Mukurweini, especially the road \\nnetwork.  Whereas  Nyeri  County  has  modestly  received  some  good  infrastructural  projects \\nparticularly  roads,  Mukurweini  Constituency  has  lagged  behind.  It  has  not  benefited  from \\ntarmac  roads for the last 20  years. What  we have had is  a very  small  contribution  from  the \\nnational kitty to the road network. I am promising the people of Mukurweini that as we work \\ntogether with the Kenya Kwanza Government, we shall be addressing the issue of roads that \\nwere proposed and passed. I was very much involved in lobbying, unfortunately, they were not \\ndone  because  there  were  no  funds.  We  are  in  touch  with  departments  that  are  involved, \\nincluding  the  National  Treasury  to  ensure  that  enough  money  is  provided  for  in  the \\nConstituency.  \\n\\nI  am  very  keen  on  ensuring  that  the  road  that  goes  through  Gikondi  all  the  way  to \\nKabuta is completed. I will ensure that the road that goes from Ichamara all the way to Rutune \\nand all the way to Gakonya is done. The road that goes from Maseno to Ndhia-Kamolo will \\nalso be done. We will work with the Government departments that are in charge of roads so \\nthat the road that goes from  Mikiraniru all the way to  Gumba-Tuguyoini is  done. I am  also \\nkeen to ensure that the Gaikundo-Kanunga-Kaheti Road all the way to Gatiki is also done. I \\nwill  be  pushing  for  these  infrastructural  projects.    I  will  also  be  very  keen  on  Karindi-\\nWahunduru  and  Karindi-Rurii  Road.  This  will  take  our  Constituency  to  a  level  that  other \\nconstituencies are enjoying. \\n\\nI am keen on the issue of irrigation in my constituency. We will be pushing for major \\nprojects in irrigation particularly on the larger Kiganjo area which serves Mukurweini West. \\nWe are going to push the Nyawamu Irrigation Scheme that serves Gikondi. We will ensure that \\nwe  complete  the  Hamaiko  Irrigation  Project  that  has  already  started.  I  will  also  push  the \\nMungagaga Water Irrigation Project to have most parts of Mukurweini covered.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I am encouraging our Government to show concern on the plight \\nof young people in this country.  Mukurweini has had very many hardworking young people \\nwho have not benefitted from post-secondary school education. I know this is an area that we \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

We will have a project called akili ni mali, where we are going to empower \\nyoung people to gain education and employment skills that will make them employable and be \\nable  to  employ.  We  will  make  use  of  technical  institutions  like  Mukurweini  Technical \\nInstitution and others to promote our young people and ensure they get away from shopping \\ncentres and the illicit brew which is a great concern in the Mount Kenya Region.  \\n\\nI call upon our Government to declare illicit brew a national disaster. It is ravaging our \\nyouth  and  making  them  useless  in  our  community.  In  future,  I  will  bring  a  Motion  in  this \\nAssembly to have it declared a national disaster. I will propose that we fight manufacturing, \\nproduction and distribution of illicit brew which has become a menace in this country.  It has \\nmade our young people unproductive. It has also made them zombies in some areas. They are \\nnot able to think on their own without consuming drugs. \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  I  will  also  be  very  keen  working  together  with  the  Rural \\nElectrification  and  Renewable  Energy  Corporation  (REREC)  and  the  Kenya  Power  and \\nLightning  Company  (KPLC)  to  ensure  that  Mukurweini  benefits  fully  from  the  Last  Mile \\nProgramme. We have very many people in Mukurweini who do not  enjoy electricity at this \\ntime and age. Mukurwein is probably the second worst connected constituency in Nyeri County \\nafter one of the neighbouring sub-  counties in  the upper side of Nyeri.  We will be working \\ntogether in ensuring that every home gets and enjoys electricity connectivity.  I know that if \\nwe support our people fully, since they are very hard working, they will be keen to use their \\nGod-given capacity and work hard to produce. This will benefit and empower them.  \\n\\nI know for sure the people of Mukurweini produce so much milk in this country. We \\nhave contributed largely to the growth and development of the economy through dairy farming. \\nWe have sweet potatoes and arrow roots. If they are properly supported and given the capacity, \\nthey will produce more and contribute to the economic growth of our country. \\n\\nAs a country, we have to tap into the potential of our young people. I am looking at \\nyoung people across the country because we are not making proper use of their capacity. We \\nare not engaging them fully to get them to the level and potential that will contribute to our \\neconomic growth.  \\n\\nI  beg  to  second  this  Motion  and  hope  that  all  my  colleagues  are  going  to  get  an \\n\\nopportunity to make their contributions today. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\n \\n\\n(Question put and agreed to) \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, this is a kind request. As we move to the next \\nOrder, I politely ask, as a good gesture to the Members who are new in the House and are here \\nfor the first time and need to make their maiden speeches, to be given priority. Their electorate \\nand  constituents  are  waiting  to  hear  from  them.  If  the  senior  Members  could,  at  least,  cede \\nspace for them, it will be a collegial thing to do in the House. I am persuading, including my \\nvery good friend, Sir. George, to cede space if he can. It is entirely up to you. I also see that I \\nhave Members who had already spoken just shortly and their cards are still in place. Kindly, \\ncede it to give other people an opportunity. We can get all the new Members to speak today \\nplus more. Like the Member for Mbeere North, you just spoke, but I can see you are still on \\nthe list with your card.  \\n\\nThank you. \\n \\n\\nMOTION \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker: Sorry, Hon. Elsie Muhanda. \\nHon. Elsie Muhanda (Kakamega County, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nI want to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment as the Deputy Speaker \\nand specifically, coming from the women caucus. Indeed, we are overjoyed.   \\n\\nI want to thank the people of Kakamega for electing me tano tena overwhelmingly.  I \\nmake a special dedication of this Motion to the child in Kakamega and Kenya as a whole, who \\ndid not get a meal today. I beg to move the following Motion: \\n\\nThat, aware that school meals are an important safety net for vulnerable children \\nfrom  food  insecure  households  and  communities  in  Kenya;  appreciating  that  school \\nmeals  have  multiple  benefits  such  as  increased  school  enrollments  and  attendants; \\nsignificant  and  positive  contribution  to  reducing  hunger  and  improving  nutritional \\nintakes; noting that primary school completion rates have been found to be higher in \\nschools that provide meals; thus school meals remain a core development intervention \\nto support the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s achievements in the education sector.   \\n\\nRecognising  that  some  county  governments  have  adopted  direct  and \\ncommunity-led  initiatives  for  Early  Childhood  Development  and  Education  (ECDE) \\nschool feeding programs; concerned that the exercise is not supported by a clear policy \\nand budgetary framework and it does not support children in primary and secondary \\nschools  who  form  the  basic  education  ecosystem;    cognizant  of  the  fact  that  where \\nschool  meal  programs  have  been  initiated,  it  has  been  noted  that  they  encounter \\ndifferent challenges that impede their effectiveness. This includes insufficient resources \\ndue  to  low  budgetary  allocation  and  budget  cuts;  lack  of  a  school  feeding  policy; \\ninadequate safe cooking and drinking water; drought and famine; poor food storage; a \\nlengthy procurement process; insecurity and dilapidated infrastructure among others. \\n\\nThis  House,  therefore,  resolves,  that  the  Ministry  of  Education,  through  the \\nrelevant State department, immediately develops a school feeding policy to cover basic \\neducation pupils, and sustain the program in order to ensure that children are maintained \\nin schools for effective learning and improve their wellbeing. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, let me begin by defining school feeding as the provision of food, \\nmeals, snacks or take-home incentives conditional upon school attendance to children, and their \\nhouseholds through school-based programs.  The meals are either prepared at schools, in the \\ncommunity or delivered from centralised kitchens. Article 53(c) of the Constitution of Kenya \\nstates that every child has a right to basic nutrition, shelter and health care.  Referring to the \\npoverty Index of 2022, 17 per cent of Kenyan population live below Kshs200 per day. This \\nmeans that 8.9 million Kenyans live in extreme poverty.   \\n\\nKenya is ranked No.86 out of 117 qualifying countries in the 2019 Global Hunger Index \\nthus classifying the countries situation as serious, and hence shows the level of real dire need.   \\nThe  World  Food  Programme (WFP)  has  shown  that  most  people  who  are  most \\nvulnerable  to  food  security  live  in  the  dry  areas  which  covers  80  per  cent  of  the  country. \\nChildren are the demographic group that is most vulnerable to hunger because their growing \\nbodies are more vulnerable. About 29 per cent of the children in rural areas and 20 per cent of \\nthose living in towns have stunted growth.   \\n\\n The  Coronavirus  disease  of  2019  did  not  make things  easy.  We  have  had  efforts  to \\nhave  feeding  programs  in  Kenya  since  1980s.  We  had  the  Maziwa  ya  Nyayo  and  Non-\\nGovernmental Organizations (NGOs) such as the Food for Education who partnered with some \\nMembers of Parliament like the Member for Dagoretti South. Because of the grave situation, \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Members who have started feeding programs in their areas like Hon. Christopher \\nAseka and Hon. Milemba. We thank them, but it is not easy given the budgetary constraints.   \\nWe equally have the Ministry of Education which has some feeding programs in ASAL \\nareas and slums. This is not enough because the whole of Kenya needs the feeding program.  \\nUsed primarily to  incentivise enrolment  and retention  of rural  children and girls,  subsidised \\nmeal programs have played an integral part in realising the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goals of universal primary \\neducation.   \\n\\nHistorically, the involvement of NGOs has greatly limited the Kenyan Government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nrole  in  the  direction  of  stewardship  of  these  programs.    Reliance  on  donor  support  and \\nmanagement has subjected the programs to fluctuating and often, conditional support from the \\nactors.    Financial  strains  and  infrastructural  challenges  have  been  the  major  setback  in  the \\nGovernment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to successfully fund and operate its own feeding program.  Noting the \\neffects  of  the  recent  COVID-19  Pandemic,  it  has  really  affected  the  primary  attendance  of \\nschools.    You  find  that  most  children  have  not  been  guaranteed  completion  of  their  school \\nlearning. The risks for children during this pandemic have included families falling into deeper \\npoverty,  threats  to  survival,  health  and  child  safety  and  extravagation  of  the  learning  crisis. \\nWide  spread  unemployment,  income  loss  and  budget  constraints  have  severely,  affected \\nhousehold financial ability to keep students in schools. As for the poorest households, budget \\nconstraints have caused them to keep their children out of school.  Since schools re-opened, \\nchildren have not reported to school in many parts of Kakamega County.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  for  the  sake  of  that  poor  child  in  Kenya  who  fainted  during \\nparade  because  of  hunger;  for  the  sake  of  the  poor  parents;  for  the  sake  of  us  having  high \\nretention; for the sake of the child who fell prey to goodies along the road because of lack of \\nfood and eventually got pregnant; for the sake of children in the drought areas; and for the sake \\nof  malnourished  children,  the  school  feeding  program  must  work.  As  I  conclude,  this  is \\nimportant in order for the Government to ensure a 100 per cent transition from pre-primary to \\nprimary, to secondary enrolment and also improve attendance. School meals are an important \\nsafety net strategy for the disadvantaged vulnerable majority of school going children facing \\nsecurity challenges in Kenyan households and communities.  \\n\\nTherefore,  I  wish  to  request  the  Members  to  support  me  and  resolve  that  the \\nGovernment, through the Ministry of Education and the relevant State departments, to develop \\na school feeding policy. This will ensure a coordinated approach to provision of school meals \\nfor  learners  at  all  basic  levels  of  education  and  propose  budgetary  allocation  to  sustain  this \\nprogram, so as to ensure that children are maintained in schools for effective learning.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I beg to move and request Hon. Omboko Milemba to second this \\n\\nMotion. Thank you. \\nHon. Omboko Milemba (Emuhaya, ANC): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. Let me \\n \\ncongratulate  Hon.  Elsie  of  Kakamega  County  for  moving  this  Motion  on  school  feeding \\nprogram. I will be very brief. The earliest signs of trying to introduce school feeding program \\nin Kenya can be traced as early as 1941. The colonial government tried what they called first \\nnational schools meals policy. Mainly, this was to give proteins to students because the children \\nwere being fed a lot of carbohydrates.  \\n\\nThe second most pronounced one would be what the Mover mentioned as the Nyayo \\nmilk\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98maziwa ya Nyayo\\xe2\\x80\\x99 which lasted for a period of about 10 years from 1980\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to 1990\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. \\nLet me put it into perspective that later on, this Parliament tried to introduce \\xe2\\x80\\x98maziwa ya Nyayo\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\nthrough a Bill introduced by a nominated Member, Hon. Beatrice Kwamboka, for those who \\nwill remember. However, it did not go through because when they looked at the costing, they \\nthought it was too expensive for those who were in the 11th Parliament.  \\n\\nThe  cost  was  approximated  to  be  Kshs1  billion  per  week  and  when  Parliament \\ncalculated it, they thought it was not really possible to have the programme running. The truth \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Currently,  the  Ministry, \\ntogether with other partners, is able to provide food in 10 counties. This is to all students mainly \\nin the ASAL areas like Makueni and other regions which most Members are aware of. They \\nare  providing  food  all  the  way  from  Grade  One  to  Class  Eight.  They  also  provide  fortified \\nporridge  to  young  children  in  those  areas.  There  has  also  been  an  attempt  by  the  Kenyan \\nGovernment to provide the same programme in informal sectors. Just to mention, in Nairobi, \\nwe have Mathare and Kibera. I can even widen and mention Kisumu where Obunga is receiving \\npart of these foods. In Kakamega, we have the Malemba area.  \\n\\nAs you know, I have a background in education. The Kenyan Government is trying to \\ndo something to provide meals in schools. What is the cost? Currently, the Government is using \\na budget of Kshs1.8 billion to do what I have just talked about. This shows very clearly that it \\nis  possible  to  achieve  this  if  this  House  pronounces  itself  on  this  matter  and  forces  that  the \\nGovernment provides a budget for school feeding. What would be the advantages of school \\nfeeding? I will take you to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which envisaged that \\nby  the  year  2015,  every  learner  in  primary  and  basic  education  will  be  able  to  finish  their \\neducation, whether a girl or a boy. Currently, most of the girls drop out because they have to \\nbe  engaged  in  domestic  chores  in  food  production.  The  boys  are  also  engaged  in  issues  of \\nlivestock keeping.  \\n\\nTherefore, if this good Motion is pronounced by this Parliament, we shall safeguard all \\nthe students in schools. So, we will retain them in school and they will transit 100 per cent. All \\nthe students who go to primary school must transit to secondary school. More so, remember in \\nthe Education Act, basic education is not only free, but is supposed to be compulsory. So, this \\nis a program that will ensure students are in school.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I have had my own experience with the school feeding program. \\nI must acknowledge Hon. Aseka who tutored me into these things. In my own constituency, \\nwe  use  partners  and  other  sources  to  provide  lunch  for  students  in  schools,  especially  the \\ncandidates. It is working for me and is popular. I want to tell this House that it has increased \\ntransition and also attendance.  \\n\\nFor instance, in 2017, the candidates in Class Eight were only about 2,000. The number \\nof candidates last year rose to 3,400 because of the school feeding program. Therefore, I want \\nto urge this House to support this Motion and the Government to create a budget for the feeding \\nprogram in our schools.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, because I want many Members to contribute to this Motion, I \\nwill not go on. This is a matter that is with us in our constituencies. You can feel it because \\nyou see hungry students going back to school after taking plain water only.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I beg to second. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, I will propose the Question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members,  I see there are many Members who want  to \\ncontribute.  I  now  call  upon  Member  for  West  Pokot  County.  The  Member  for  West  Pokot \\nCounty is not here. I now call upon the Member for Matungulu. \\nHon.  Stephen  Mule  (Matungulu,  WDM):  Thank  you  very  much,  Hon.  Deputy \\n \\nSpeaker. From the onset, I want to thank the people of Matungulu for electing me to this august \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I want to congratulate you on being elected as Deputy Speaker of this \\nHouse.  \\n\\nI want to thank my sister Hon. Elsie for moving this Motion to deal with school feeding \\nprogramme in Kenya. I want to thank all Members for the support they gave us when we were \\nworking on entrenching Constituency Development Fund (CDF) in the Constitution. I want to \\nreport to you that we have worked tirelessly with Hon. Gichimu and made sure that the entire \\nlegislation,  workings  of  the  budgets  and  the  figures  that  need  to  be  entrenched  in  the \\nConstitution are done. The work is now beyond our hands. We have submitted it to the Table \\nOffice  and  it  has  been  forwarded  to  the  Speaker.  By  the  time  we  come  back  from  recess,  I \\nbelieve we will start the journey to amend the Constitution to entrench CDF. We are keen on \\nthis  because  Members  of  Parliament  are  very  key  to  this  Motion  on  feeding  programme.  I \\nbelieve that if we increase the allocations to CDF, National Government Affirmative Action \\nFund  (NGAAF)  and  have  Oversight  Authority  and  Stimulus  Economic  Fund  in  the \\nConstitution, Members of Parliament will be in  a position to  feed our children in  the  entire \\ncountry.  I  believe  this  House  has  the  power  to  make  laws  and  give  direction.  What  Hon. \\nGichimu and I have started will sort out the issue of inadequate budget which has been talked \\nabout  by  Hon.  Milemba  Omboko.  We  will  do  this  through  the  National  Government \\nConstituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF). \\n\\nWhen we begin this journey, I would like to urge Members to be vigilant and know our \\nenemy. You need to understand that the same enemy we had in 2015 when NG-CDF was in \\nplace is in court again to make it unconstitutional. If we want to have such Motions to proceed \\nand have enough funding, we must think outside the box, walk the talk and rise above the bar. \\nThat is why Hon. Gichimu and I have taken a bold step to amend the Constitution to entrench \\nthese  funds  in  the  Constitution  and  delink  them  from  any  interference  from  the  courts.  If \\nMembers  agree  to  our  proposed  amendment  to  entrench  NG-CDF,  NGAAF  and  the \\nempowerment fund in the Constitution, we will not be bothered to ask the government to deal \\nwith  school  feeding  programme.  It  will  be  one  of  your  priorities  as  national  leaders  in  this \\nHouse to budget for a feeding programme in your constituency. Let us look at this job seriously. \\nI am very sure that if we increase CDF from 2.5 per cent to 5 per cent, each Member will have \\nan opportunity to feed Kenyan children without crying to  the  government  for subsidies and \\nextra food for schools.  \\n\\nI thank Hon. Elsie. This is a Motion that Members of this House will approve. Once we \\ncome back from recess, we will start the journey to amend the Constitution for the benefit of \\nKenyans  who  elected  you.  I  believe  that  once  we  entrench  CDF,  NGAAF  and  have  an \\nEconomic Stimulus Fund in the Constitution, we will be in a position to appropriate money \\naccordingly without begging anybody. It is very clear. \\n \\n\\n(Hon. Kassait Kamket spoke off the record) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Kamket, we are not dealing with cows here. We are talking of serious matters of \\nfeeding students in this country. What is out of order? I have served for two terms in this House. \\nTo new Members, serving the people will be very difficult if you do not have CDF. It will be \\nvery difficult when you will not be able to give students bursaries in January and feed them \\nwithout funds come next year. We are the people who appropriate funds in this House. We are \\nthe people who allocate funds to other government departments. I do not see why we cannot \\nallocate funds to NGAAF to feed Kenyan children. We must rise above the board. When we \\nstarted this journey, we were required to get only 50 signatures. I want to thank you Members \\nfor  appending  your  signatures.  Even  Hon.  Kamket  signed  on.  There  are  335  Members  in \\nsupport of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker: The Member for Tiaty, you are out of order. You will not catch \\nthe Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye by shouting out loud from the corner of a Chamber after just walking in. Let \\nthe Hon. Mule finish his submission. \\n\\nHon.  Stephen  Mule  (Matungulu,  WDM):  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  it  is  good  to  tame \\nsome of these people. We are talking of children in primary and secondary schools. Parents \\ncannot afford school fees and three meals a day. This is a Motion that every Member should \\nsupport as we go on recess. When we come back, we should work as a team to provide funds \\nand become oversight managers. In the outside world, you are seen as the CDF managers. I \\nwant to tell Kenyans that Hon. Mule, Hon. Rasso and Hon. Gichimu do not sign for any CDF \\npenny. We only offer oversight. There is a constituency committee that does that. What other \\ndevolved government do we need in this country if not for NGAAF? \\n\\nI  want  to  urge  the  Judiciary  not  to  listen  to  everyone  who  walks  to  the  courts  with \\npropaganda or hearsay. They have no clue how much Members of Parliament have assisted \\nstudents from Form One to university without paying school fees. There is no other way we \\nare  going  to  alleviate  poverty  in  this  country  without  funds  at  the  grassroots.  The  county \\ngovernments are performing their duties but during weekends, Kenyans seek  your help as a \\nMember of Parliament so that their children can go to school. On this Motion, Kenyans are \\nlooking up to you to make sure that every primary and secondary school has enough money to \\nfeed students. If we allocate money to the school feeding programme, we will tell principals \\nand head teachers to ensure that students are in school until we get enough money to pay school \\nfees. They should not send students back to their parents every weekend for lack of school fees. \\nLet us walk together as Members and entrench CDF and NGAAF in the Constitution and make \\nsure that a provision to feed Kenyan children is included in the next legislation. I urge school \\nprincipals to maintain students in school so that they can learn and prepare for exams before \\nDecember. Once we sort out this NGAAF menace, we will send cheques to schools and make \\nsure that you get enough money to pay school debts and to maintain students in school come \\nJanuary. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Mule, there are many new Members who have not made \\ntheir  maiden  speeches.  Let  us  give  them  an  opportunity.  Hon.  Member,  let  us  give  an \\nopportunity to the rest. Many new Members have not made their maiden speeches. I now call \\nupon the Member for Matayos Constituency. He will be followed by the Member for Samburu \\nCounty. We will then give a second chance to the Member for West Pokot who was not there \\nwhen I called her earlier.  \\n\\nThank you.  \\nHon.  Geoffrey  Odanga  (Matayos,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  for \\n\\n \\ngiving me this opportunity. \\n\\nI thank the people of Matayos Constituency in Busia County for giving me a third term \\nto  serve  them  as  their  Member  of  Parliament.  That  goes  a  long  way  to  demonstrate  the \\nconfidence they have in  me and  I assure them that  I will give them my best  so that we can \\ndevelop on what we started with them. I want to be in the rankings of Hon. Duale, Hon. Millie \\nOdhiambo, Hon. Moroto, and many others who have served five terms and beyond. \\n\\nI also  congratulate  you on your election as our Deputy Speaker. However, I want to \\nregister  my  disappointment,  that  I  came  to  this  House  a  few  minutes  after  1.00  pm.  I  was \\nnumber 10 on that queue. I have seen Members who have come after me, including one who \\ncame and I assisted him to slot in his card, given a chance to speak and go, despite my appeal \\nto the substantive Speaker to give me an opportunity.  \\n\\nI am from the ward. I have been in the hospital for about two weeks. I was operated \\nupon on my neck. This is the first time I am appearing here without a neck collar. I thought I \\nshould have been given a chance to speak on these important Motions, including the one that \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I wanted to comment on it \\neven after it had been done with. \\n\\nI realised that in as much as the Joint Committee has Members of ability to serve or to \\nelect our Members to the EALA, it is regionally and religiously imbalanced. It is against the \\ntenets  of  the  Constitution.  Having  said  that,  this  Motion  moved  by  Hon.  Elsie  who  is  the \\nMember for Kakamega is very worthy being before this House. She is talking about developing \\na policy. I want Members to mark the word \\xe2\\x80\\x98policy\\xe2\\x80\\x99. I know all of us agree that we should have \\nschool feeding programmes. The Motion is talking about the Government developing a policy \\non the school feeding programme. \\n\\nWe have had various programmes that have been developed very haphazardly in the \\ncountry.  Some  have  been  developed  by  the  county  governments,  while  others  have  been \\ndeveloped  by  the  national  Government.  The  aim  is  providing  food  to  some  institutions,  but \\nthere is no policy. We would have no problem in attracting access of our children to schools, \\nif a policy was in place. We would have no problem in maintaining them in school throughout. \\nWe need a policy for this. Just  as Mheshimiwa Omboko Milemba has said about the Nyayo \\nmilk that came in the late 70s - around 1979 - some of us enjoyed it. It went on up to, perhaps, \\nthe  middle  80s  to  the  90s.  Many  children  were  kept  in  school.  We  really  implore  that  as \\nMembers,  we  should  support  this  Motion  for  the  Government  to  develop  a  policy  that  will \\nmake sure our childrens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 well-being in nutrition and health are maintained. That is to ensure \\nthey are in school and are able to learn without problems.  \\n \\nthe queue.  \\n \\n\\nI want to insist that we want this Parliament to give fairness to Members who are on \\n\\n(An Hon.

What is on your queue there should be reflected on our tablets here or on the walls, \\nso that I can know when I am number two and I should be given a chance to contribute after \\nthe first person. We also know that you enjoy discretion as per the Standing Orders. I do not \\nhave to sit here for three hours and a Member comes in, speaks and leaves. That is very unfair \\nto some of us Hon. Members. I also implore you that you do another induction. Members are \\nnot inducted enough. While seated here, I have seen two Members just cross from here. Can \\nyou please organise for an induction? I support Hon. Deputy Speaker.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you for the feedback, Member for Matayos.

I do not take it for \\ngranted.  It  is,  indeed, a  great  honour  and privilege they have  given me.  My  great  people of \\nMwatate,  I  assure  you  that  I  will  serve  you  with  a  lot  of  commitment,  tirelessly  and  with \\ndedication. Special appreciation goes to my family and friends for offering total support before, \\nduring and after the elections.  \\nSecondly, I take this opportunity to congratulate you and the Speaker for being elected \\n \\nto serve in this 13th Parliament.

Andrew Mwadime, who is now the Governor of Taita Taveta County. I congratulate him \\nfor his election. I wish him well in his new elective position.  \\n \\nMwatate  Constituency  has  its  own  uniqueness  and  challenges.  The  first  one  is \\nelectricity. Electricity connectivity has been a nightmare in Mwatate. We have only 30 per cent \\nconnectivity in Mwatate. This creates many issues in the employment of our youth. We have \\nTVETs there. The youth have trained and they have graduated. Some of them are welders and \\nthey have not been able to access electricity so that they can open Jua Kali workshops. I request \\nthe Government, through this honourable House, to add the grid of electricity in Mwatate so \\nthat we can help our youth and get them out of unemployment. \\n \\nSecondly, the roads are in a very poor state. I have been hearing from the last regime \\nthat 10,000 kilometres of roads have been constructed. I am not good in mathematics, but when \\nI try to divide the 10,000 by the 47 counties that we have. I found out that what we got in Taita \\nTaveta as a whole was only 40 kilometres of tarmacked road. I think our county has been short-\\nchanged. In terms of development, we found out that some counties are more developed. They \\nare getting more development than our county. I am requesting our new Government to allocate \\nTaita Taveta some money in the next budget for the construction of some more kilometres so \\nthat we can have access to our homes through those tarmacked roads. That is my request.  \\n\\nAnother challenge my constituency is facing is the problem of water. We have been \\nhaving  a  lot  of  problems  in  terms  of  getting  water.  In  fact,  it  is  very  scarce  in  Mwatate \\nConstituency. I am now requesting the Government, through this honourable House, if it can \\norganise so that we can tap water from Taveta.  We have got a lot of water from Taveta which \\nis our neighbouring constituency, almost 80 kilometres away. I urge the Government to tap the \\nwater to Mwatate to help our people there to get enough water for domestic use and irrigation.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n[The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Gladys Boss) left the Chair] \\n\\n \\n\\n[The Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari) took the Chair] \\n\\nMwatate is a constituency which houses the headquarters of Taita Taveta County and \\nalso  a  business  hub  which  is  growing  very  fast.  The  economic  activities  in  Mwatate  are \\nbasically mining. Almost 70 per cent of Taita Taveta, Mwatate included, is composed of all \\ntypes of mines. Name any mineral, it is there. Our main economic activity is mostly mining. \\nOur youth in the mines are having problems because they do not have machinery to help them \\nexplore the minerals so that we can change the economy of Mwatate. Therefore, my request is \\nfor the current Government to make sure it provides the machinery so that the people can use \\nthem for mining purposes to uplift the economy of Mwatate. In fact, in the near future, I will \\nbring a Motion to declare mining in Taita Taveta an economic activity. When the Government \\nis supporting miraa, coffee and tea, the same should also be done to our small-scale miners so \\nthat we can tap the minerals to help our people develop.  \\n\\nLast but not least, let me speak on the Motion which is before us - the school feeding \\nprogramme.  Let  me  say  that  due  to  this  drought,  Mwatate  has  been  hit  hard  especially  the \\nschool children. Many of them had dropped out in the first term. But in second term, as the \\narea MP, by the grace of God, I managed to introduce a school feeding programme for the 68 \\nprimary schools and, up to now, they are food sufficient. However, that programme is not going \\nto  take long.  I think by the end of this term,  I  will not  be able to  support them again.  So,  I \\nsupport the Motion.  \\n\\nGod bless Kenya, God bless Mwatate. Thank you. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. (Ms.) Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. Member. \\n\\nThe next chance will go to the County Member of Parliament for Samburu County.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

(Ms.) Pauline Lenguris (Samburu CWR, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Temporary \\nSpeaker, for giving me this opportunity. This is the first time I am speaking in this House and \\nI am so grateful. Secondly, let me thank the great people of Samburu for giving me this chance \\nto  represent  them  in  this  House.  I  am  grateful  to  them  for  electing  me  as  their  Woman \\nRepresentative.  I  started  this  journey  long  time  ago  -  15  years  down  the  line  -  and  I  am  so \\nhumbled for the trust they have bestowed upon me this time. I promise to serve them diligently, \\nwithout bias and with all the respect that they deserve.  \\n\\nThirdly,  let  me  thank  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Kenya,  His  Excellency  Dr. \\nWilliam Samoei Ruto  for the support he offered me during the campaign time. Let  me also \\ncongratulate him on being elected the President of this country. He is also my party leader and \\nI am so grateful for the support and the plans he has for this country. Because we know that we \\ninherited a country which the economy has really gone down, the people are suffering and I \\nunderstand from his agenda that he has good programmes that will put this country back to the \\nline  again.  Programmes  like  the  Hustler  Fund,  housing  and  universal  healthcare.  Those \\nprogrammes are going to support and help our people and hence, I believe that this honourable \\nHouse will give him the support that he requires to implement them. They will be able to uplift \\nthe lives of our people.  \\n\\nFourthly, I come from a region that is currently hardest hit by the drought. I think you \\nhave all seen on the televisions and also heard from the press statements that have been given \\nby Members from that region - northern Kenya. We are really faced by a very hard drought \\nand our people are really suffering because of hunger. We have lost many livestock and many \\nof our children are dropping out of school because the parents are not able to pay for the school \\nfees. The schools are also not able to feed the children. So, we are suffering both in the homes \\nand our children are suffering back in the schools. The country is facing a severe drought and \\nthe  threat  is  worsening  each  and  every  day.  The  household  food  security  has  really  been \\naffected and there has been minimal harvest in agro-pastoralist areas.  \\n\\nHon.  Temporary  Speaker,  water  has  also  become  a  major  challenge  for  both  human \\nbeings  and  livestock.  The  discharge  levels  have  gone  down.  Most  strategic  boreholes  have \\neither broken down or the discharge levels have gone down. Conflicts over pasture have also \\nerupted in most parts in Samburu County and, as the Member representing the County, I would \\nrequest  the  Government  to  spearhead  the  support  and  interventions  that  would  address  the \\nsuffering that people are undergoing in that County and region. We are talking of Samburu, \\nMarsabit,  Isiolo,  West  Pokot  and  parts  of  Turkana.  If  the  Government  is  not  going  to  do \\nsomething, we fear that lives are going to be lost.  \\n\\nThis week, I was in the county and we got reports of an old man who passed on due to \\nhunger.  So,  I  am  here  requesting  the  Government  to  fast-track  the  interventions.  Even  the \\ndevelopment partners who are working in this country; if there is any kind of support they can \\nbe able to give us, let them do so. We are requesting for any kind of support. Any other good \\nKenyan who is willing to support our people is highly welcome.  \\n\\nOn the school feeding programme, I support that it can be reinstated so that we can have \\nretention of our children back in school, especially now that the parents are not even able to \\npay their school fees.  \\n\\nThank  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker,  for  giving  me  the  opportunity.  Maybe  I  can \\n\\ndonate some of the minutes to the Members who have not spoken.  \\n\\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. (Ms.) Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. Member. \\n\\nThe next chance will go to the Member for Wajir South, Hon. Mohammed Adow.  \\n\\nHon. Mohammed Adow (Wajir South, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker, \\nfor giving me this opportunity. I would like to thank the people of Wajir South for electing me \\nas their representative in this House. I also thank the hundreds of volunteers who helped me \\nthroughout  the  campaign  period,  showed  confidence  in  me  and  my  leadership  and  made  a \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I  represent  Wajir  South,  which  is  the  second  largest \\nconstituency in this country; second only to North Horr in Marsabit. The size of Wajir South \\nis  about  23,000  square  kilometres.    To  give  a  snapshot,  that  is  the  size  of  Nairobi,  Central \\nKenya  and  Western  Kenya  combined.    It  is  represented  by  one  Member  of  Parliament.    I \\nbelieve, that is a blot on the conscience of Kenyans.  We have been short-changed many times \\nwhen  boundary  reviews  of  constituencies  have  been  carried  out.  We  hope  this  time  round, \\njustice, equity and even even-handedness will prevail.   \\n\\nWajir South has four sub-counties; with only two which are fully operational. The other \\ntwo are work in progress. The sheer size of the constituency makes it really difficult for delivery \\nof  services  not  just  from  the  Member  of  Parliament  and  other  elected  leaders,  but  also \\ngovernment and aid workers, who are in the process of alleviating the biting drought that is \\nafflicting my people at this time. \\n\\nDrought is a big problem right now for the people of Wajir South.  Over the years, we \\nhave seen cyclic droughts that have decimated livestock and made the people really weak. Over \\nthe past five years, we have had the lethal mix of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the locust invasion \\nas well as the drought. Last year, it was declared a national disaster. This year again, it is the \\nsame.  \\n\\nWe are here talking about drought and it is getting worse and worse by the day.  This \\nis the consequence of climate change, and it is here to stay with us. It is about time we learnt \\nto adapt and live with climate change.  It is a  global phenomenon and not much of our own \\nmaking.  But  we  are  bearing  the  brunt  of  the  ruthlessness  by  which  Western  industrialised \\ncountries have dealt with our environment. But we must adapt because if we do not, we will be \\nhaving  even  more  problems.    Right  now,  there  are  discussions  going  on  not  just  in  my \\nconstituency  and  the  greater  Wajir  County,  but  also  in  other  parts  of  the  country  that  are \\nafflicted by the dry spell.  Pastoralism, as we have seen over the ages, is untenable. We can no \\nlonger continue to chase rainfall because it has become less and far between.  What we need is \\nto adapt and change our lifestyles so that we get to live a much better life than the one we are \\nliving right now. That is because every year, we are seeing caravans of relief convoys taking \\nfood to the people. To an extent, we have been reduced to a people dependent on the goodwill \\nof  others.    We  are  talking  about  agro-pastoralism,  more  settled  farming  as  well  as  keeping \\nlivestock which is a priced source of livelihood for the people of the North, where Wajir South \\nis located.   \\n \\nWe can no longer continue as our forefathers to chase the rain, even if it meant crossing \\nthe borders because there is very little rain due to the phenomenon that we are facing.  We are \\ntalking about agriculture as an alternative mainstay for our people, so that they can grow their \\nown food and fodder for their livestock. That way, we would be able to keep on practising our \\npriced mainstay that is pastoralism and rearing of animals while, at the same time, growing our \\nown food.  This is where we are headed and we will be seeking as much help as possible in this \\ndirection.   \\n\\nAs we speak, there are throngs of aid workers criss-crossing Wajir County. The county \\ngovernment has re-jigged its budget and is offering relief aid to the people.  We are thankful to \\nthe county Governor and also to organisations like Save the Children, Kenya Red Cross, United \\nNations Childrens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Fund and many others including World Vision, which are giving lifesaving \\naid and water to the people in my constituency.   \\n\\nThere are seven wards in my constituency and, out of those wards; three of them are \\nfacing water shortage. So, as we can see, my work is really cut out for me. I represent people \\nwho are facing all those problems that I have listed. \\n\\n Hon. Temporary Speaker, we have a fantastic Motion in front of us today.  It is one \\nthat deals with the provision of school meals to students. When I remember my childhood and \\ngrowing up in North Eastern Kenya, the school feeding programme made a big difference by \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

School  meals  really  contributed  to  many  of  us  remaining  in  school \\nbecause of the abject poverty most of the people there were living under and still do to this day.   \\n\\nI am in support of this Motion, but we have even a more pressing problem in North \\nEastern Kenya because of the action which the former Government took two years ago. With \\na stroke of a pen, 5,000 teachers were recalled from the region because of insecurity.  Today, \\nalmost  every  other  school  is  manned  by  one  teacher.    In  my  constituency  alone,  we  have  a \\nshortage of 300 school teachers.  Some of the schools in my constituency are manned by one \\nteacher and some of them  have been  closed. This is  quite unfair. We are bringing up a lost \\ngeneration which has been forced to go through the steps of schooling for those two years, but \\nhave learnt nothing.  We are appealing to the Teachers Service Commission (TSC), because I \\ndo not know what else to call it because this is marginalisation that is being brought through \\nthe back door, after we thought the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution had done away with \\nthat practise, which had been visited upon us by the previous regimes.  What we need is a return \\nof teachers back to the schools so that the young Kenyans living in that part of the country can \\nget education. \\n\\nWe have\\xe2\\x80\\xa6. I thought I had ten minutes Hon. Temporary Speaker! \\nThe  Temporary  Speaker  (Hon.  (Ms.)  Martha  Wangari):  Yes,  and  they  are  almost \\n\\nover.  Just one minute or so \\n\\nHon. Mohammed Adow (Wajir South, ODM):  So, in summary, I would like to say \\nthat teachers need to go back to schools.  The funding for the school feeding programme will \\ngo a long way but again, for students who do not have teachers, it does not mean much. Thank \\nyou very much. \\n\\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. (Ms.) Martha Wangari):  Thank you Hon. Member. \\n\\nThe next chance goes to the Member for Embakasi West, Hon. Mark Mwenje. \\n\\nHon.  Mark  Mwenje  (Embakasi  West,  JP):  Finally!  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary \\n\\nSpeaker. Like most new Members would say, we have been waiting for quite a while.   \\n\\nBeing my Maiden Speech, let me start  by congratulating all the elected Members of \\nParliament. I also want to give a vote of thanks first to the Almighty God for giving me this \\nchance, to the people of Embakasi West who voted for me, to my family, my wife, my children, \\nmy sisters, my brother and all those who campaigned with me in Embakasi West. I want to \\nthank them for their support. It is obvious that my surname is quite common in Parliament. I \\nrecognise that my father served in this House. He made a name for himself while seated right \\nhere. Without him, I would not be here. To those Members who are in their third term including \\nyourself, at times, a good name is its own reward. I also recognise some of my late father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nfriends who campaigned with me, the likes of Hon. Kamanda and Hon. Ndolo. There are so \\nmany people who supported me. I cannot mention all their names.     \\n\\nI thank the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance family in Nairobi, comprising of the \\nJubilee Party and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Party. I also wish to thank the \\nfirst Member of Parliament for Embakasi West, George Theuri, for his service, for conceding \\nand for his candour.   \\n\\nI move on to Embakasi West, where during the campaigns, there were quite a number \\nof issues that we spoke about. I know I cannot speak to all of them. The people of Embakasi \\nWest require better infrastructure and roads. My constituency has some of the worst roads in \\nNairobi County. We get water once a week, or none at all. We have raw sewage spilling all \\nover.  \\n\\nWhen it comes to education, my constituency has 14 public schools versus a population \\nof 284,000 people. We have about 120 students in each classroom and that is even on the lower \\nside. One of my wards - Mowlem Ward - has only one primary school. Umoja One and Umoja \\nTwo wards share one secondary school. I come from a constituency where bursaries are issued \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Something has to \\nchange.  \\n\\nLand ownership is one of the biggest issues that we have in my constituency. People \\ndo not have title deeds. Mowlem Ward has a population of 89,000, where 70 per cent of the \\nWard is adjudicated land. So, 70 per cent of those people do not have title deeds. Whenever \\nyou hear of demolitions in Nairobi, this is the Ward that always has the highest number. That \\nhas to end.  \\n\\nWhen I talk about women and youth empowerment, it is straightforward. They need \\nfunds, training, jobs and opportunities. That is what the women and youths in my constituency \\nhave been lacking and that is what they sent me here for.  \\n\\nWith regard to  our sports infrastructure,  I come from a constituency which does not \\nhave any stadium or public grounds where some of the young men can engage in their sporting \\nactivities. This is quite unfair considering that quite a number of those facilities are in Nairobi. \\nBut my constituency lacks them. Those are some of the things, and many others, that I would \\nwant to look into. Hopefully, going forward, I will represent the people of Embakasi West.         \\n\\nEven if we are past that issue, I did not get a chance to contribute to the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nSpeech.  There  were  some  positives.  He  spoke  about  retaining  the  National  Government \\nConstituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF). As a Member of Parliament from Nairobi, I felt \\nthat the 25 per cent that is based on the number of wards punishes some of us. We have some \\nof  the  most  populous  constituencies  in  Nairobi.  That  25  per  cent  should  have  considered \\npopulation size rather than the number of wards. Going forward, that is something that I will \\nseek a review of and, hopefully, get more funds for some of the Nairobi constituencies, as I \\nwill explain a bit later on.   \\n\\nThe President spoke about education and health, which is good. But it is time that the \\nGovernment  gave us direction on the Competency  Based Curriculum  (CBC) and 8-4-4. We \\ncannot gamble with the lives of our children. Some of us who are young have children going \\nthrough this educational system. We need to be sure. We cannot be changing it after every 10 \\nyears. Whatever happens or comes out, it must be final and must last a generation.  \\n\\nHaving Cabinet Secretaries coming to the Floor of the House is a good idea, but they \\n\\nshould not come here to grandstand. Hopefully, they will be fair and respond to both sides.   \\n\\nThe Hustler Fund is a good idea, but I felt that the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech limited it. When \\nhe said that it will be issued through technology, that is not the promise that he made while he \\nwas  campaigning.  At  some  point,  he  had  said  that  he  would  make  it  quite  easy  and  have  it \\ndistributed by Members of Parliament. The Hustler Fund should be made accessible and quite \\neasy for people to apply.  \\n\\nI also wish to note that our country seems to be suffering from a campaign hangover. \\nWe even saw it here today. It is time that we accepted that somebody won. We competed and \\nelections  are  over.  We  cannot  keep  campaigning.  The  President  said  that  he  is  the  bigger \\nbrother  now.  My  colleagues  from  the  other  side  need  to  recognise  that  they  are  the  bigger \\nbrothers now. Let us not grandstand anymore. Let us allow our country to move forward.  \\n\\nYesterday,  the  President  was  in  Embakasi  Central,  and  he  visited  my  constituency. \\nSome of the things that I felt he should have mentioned in his Presidential Speech, he did so \\nwhile out there going round. Today, the Leader of the Majority Party accused the Leader of \\nOpposition,  Raila  Odinga  of  going  round.  The  President  is  doing  that.  He  spoke  of  quite \\nimportant issues. At times, it is during these public gatherings that we are able\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Actually, that \\nis why all of us are here. Without those public gatherings, none of us would have been elected. \\nYesterday,  I  heard  the  President  speak  about  increasing  the  number  of  schools  in  Nairobi, \\nensuring that we have title deeds to sort out all the land matters in Nairobi within 12 months, \\nand opening the markets.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I hope that  the Governor of Nairobi will write to  Members of Parliament from \\nNairobi County and formally communicate that position to ensure that we feed our children, \\nespecially here in Nairobi. We thank him. This is something that many parents raised a number \\nof times during the campaigns. This is long overdue. Those of us who were in school in the \\n1990s remember maziwa ya Nyayo. So, it is nothing unheard of. I support the Motion. It is long \\noverdue.  \\n\\nAs I conclude, I reiterate that for those who won, especially the Government side, you \\nneed to bring the country together. The country is taking too long to heal. We cannot let the \\ncountry continue in the same way. We have a choice. We can follow the Kibaki route which \\nunited the country. Despite Moi opposing his candidature, we can go the route that Kibaki took \\nor take a new route, which is not the right one.  \\n\\nWith that, I thank you. I look forward to working with other Members.  \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. (Ms.) Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. Member. \\n\\nNow, we will go to the Member for Mbeere North, Geoffrey Ruku.    \\n\\nHon.  Geoffrey  Kariuki  Ruku  (Mbeere  North,  DP):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary \\nSpeaker. I want to contribute to the Motion on the school-feeding policy. Tomorrow, I will be \\nhaving a meeting with the headteachers of primary schools in Mbeere North Constituency. It \\nis true that Mbeere North is facing a very serious crisis as far as drought is concerned. I have \\nseen  it  circulating  in  the  news  media  that  some  children  have  resorted  to  eating  wild  fruits \\nbecause of the drought crisis. It is extremely shameful that almost 60 years after Independence, \\nwe are unable to feed ourselves as a nation. We are experiencing very humiliating situations \\nwhich should not be happening. As we come up with a school-feeding programme, it may be \\na short-term approach to take care of the food problem in this country. It is important to have \\nshort-term programs and, at the same time, mid-term and long-term programs of dealing with \\nthe drought crisis in this country.  \\n \\nOne  of  the  Members  has  mentioned  issues  to  do  with  climate  change,  which  is \\ncompounding all these issues into a serious crisis. It is important to put a framework which will \\nguide the monies that will be coming from climate financing to ensure that they are properly \\nused by Kenya to take care of such calamities.  \\n\\nThis  House  can  propose  and  enact  a  Bill  on  climate  financing  which  will  enable  a \\nnumber of dams to be constructed in the country. In my constituency, for instance, we have \\nKamumu Dam whose design is complete. The cost is about Kshs23 billion, but the Government \\nis not able to support it with the said amount. If the dam is completed, the people of Mbeere \\nNorth will have a sustainable water supply, and the issue of drought in Mbeere North will be a \\nthing of the past.  \\n\\nWe must come up with innovative ways. One, of them was proposed by the President \\nin this House. That, a water purchase agreement will be enacted and formed by the Government \\nof the day. At the same time, we need to earn ourselves all the funding or money that is coming \\nto the counties in form of climate financing so that it can implement huge projects which can \\nmitigate the effects of climate change. Those huge projects can be effective in every county of \\nthe Republic of Kenya, so that we can have mega dams which can serve all the corners of this \\ncountry to ensure that we have enough water to irrigate our farms. That way, lack of food in \\nour households and schools will be a thing of the past. \\n\\nHowever, in the short term, it is important we move with speed so that the Government \\nof the day can be able to feed the children in our schools. They are going hungry every single \\nday. Some of them are dropping out of school and the head teachers are facing a huge crisis \\nbecause they are not able to sustain the children in school.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

But you realise that we have many pupils being sent home \\nbecause  of  small  monies  which  parents  cannot  afford.  We  need  to  know  to  what  extent  the \\nprimary school education is free? Why are primary school pupils being sent home? We are told \\nthat the National Government Constituency Fund (NGCDF) cannot support parents who are \\nunable to pay Kshs200 or Kshs500 to ensure that they have a watchman and support staff in \\nprimary schools. Those monies are needed by the head teachers of those schools.  \\n\\nAs for the disbursement of money from the Ministry of Education to primary schools, \\nthe  amount  of  money  going  to  those  schools  per  term  is  ranging  between  Kshs30,000  and \\nbelow. A sum of Kshs30,000 cannot be able to sustain a primary school for a term. So, let the \\nGovernment be committed to what it says. If it is free primary education, let it be totally, free.  \\nIt is extremely bad and shameful to see poor pupils going home and yet, their parents \\ncannot even raise Kshs200. They stay at home for even a week and, at the same time; they are \\nnot able to feed them.  \\n\\nI beg to support this Motion as a short term way of taking care of the crisis which is \\ngoing on in this country. As a nation, we need to think in terms of the long-term and how we \\ncan have innovative ways of raising money which will ensure we avert the crisis of drought in \\nthis country once and for all.  \\n\\nI beg to support.

Thank you so much. I promise to do my best to deliver the promises \\nthat I made. \\n\\n This is one of the elections that I made the highest number of promises. I have never \\nmade the kind of promises I did in any other elections. With the help of God, the power that \\nthis House has, and the blessings of the people, I will deliver. \\n\\n I also take this opportunity to thank those who volunteered to support me. Some closed \\ntheir business in Nairobi and came to the ground to help me. The youth, women and to all of \\nthem, I say thank you so much and may God bless you.  \\n\\nHon.

It is a very important one, \\nand addresses the matter of coming up with  a policy that will ensure that we have a school \\nfeeding program.  \\n\\nMy  constituency,  Kitui  South,  is  one  of  the  most  affected  in  the  country.  We  have \\nchildren who are not attending school. Some have already dropped out because there is no food \\nat home. Some are assisting their parents to get money by working here and there so that they \\ncan get food.  \\n\\nHaving  this  policy  will  ensure  that  we  get  a  way  of  ensuring  that  we  have  healthy \\nchildren who will be able to perform better in school. This will ensure that we have children \\ntransiting  from  primary,  secondary  and  possibly,  to  tertiary  institutions.  This  will  bring \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

So, by having this policy, it will eventually and \\nhopefully,  become  an  Act  of  Parliament  and  will  one  day  get  funded  just  like  the  other \\nprograms that have passed through this House. I hope we will get there. Health is wealth. The \\nbiggest  wealth that we have in  this country is  our children. Beyond provision  of electricity, \\nroads and everything that we do, our children are number one.  \\n\\nHon.  Temporary  Speaker,  we  need  to  have  this  policy  as  soon  as  possible  after  this \\nMotion is passed by this House. Once the policy is passed, we could think of identifying ways \\nwhere the sourcing of food is done from local areas. When this happens, we will promote small \\nbusinesses  within  those  communities  and  eventually  develop  the  small  business  men  and \\nwomen within the local areas. \\n \\nHon.  Temporary  Speaker,  we  have  a  very  good  Non-Governmental  Organisation \\n(NGO) in my constituency called Homegrown, that has done very well in terms of providing \\nfood in some of the schools. We are engaging to see whether we can get more. However, it is \\nimportant to note that most NGOs that are providing food are also calling upon the Government \\nto come up with proper policies and plans so that the Government itself can finance this. This \\nmatter has been raised by Homegrown, another Organization called Food for Education, East \\nChildrens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Fund and Mary Hill. This matter that our colleague is raising, also resonates very \\nwell with the NGOs that are asking that we have proper policies, rules and regulations. That \\nwe have a proper financing that can eventually ensure that our children are getting food. \\n \\nIf  this  happens,  it  will  ensure  that  the  children  in  my  constituency  are  able  to  go  to \\nschool. The stories that I am getting from my constituency are really disheartening, but we have \\na situation where teachers are bringing concentrated tea \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is tea with a lot of sugar - so that \\nduring break time, if they realise that some of the children are getting frail, then they can give \\nthem that tea so that it can sustain them. It is time that this August House raises to the occasion \\nto ensure that we have this policy and that we take other steps to ensure sustainable financing. \\nAs my colleagues have spoken, the Member for Wajir and the Hon. Member for Mbeere East, \\nsustainability is critical. It is time we know that yes, we are going to feed the children now until \\nthe near future, hopefully, if we get that policy. The issue is about ensuring that provide water \\nin especially those Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs). When we have water, then we will get \\nsustainable food production and feed the children. \\n \\nHon. Temporary Speaker, my last point will be a call to our principals and headteachers \\nin our schools that: This is a very difficult moment. We would like to ask them as Parliament \\nthat, if possible, they come up with some form of agreements with the suppliers. This is because \\nI walked into a market place in my constituency in Mutomo and I saw children in uniforms \\nfrom various secondary schools. All of them were being sent home for school fees. Yes, we do \\nnot have National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF) and most of those \\nchildren depend on it. I would like to call upon the headteachers and principals to kindly give \\nthe  House  a  chance.  Engage  the  suppliers  of  food.  Kindly  keep  the  children  in  school  and \\nhopefully in the very near future, the matter of NG-CDF will be sorted out and it will assist \\nyou to pay the bills.  \\n \\nthe opportunity to speak. May God bless you.  \\n \\nThe next chance will go to the Hon. Member for Yatta, Hon. Robert Basil. \\nHon. Robert Ngui (Yatta, WDM-K): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. Allow me \\n \\nto thank you for being in the Panel and for serving us today. I also want to thank Hon. Speaker \\nand  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker.  I  thank  the  Yatta  people  for  voting  for  me  as  their  Member  of \\nParliament (MP). It was not an easy walk. More so, people queued for long hours to cast their \\nvotes in my favour. The way to thank them is actually to serve them. I also take this moment \\n\\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Thank you too for your kind words. \\n\\nHon. Temporary Speaker, with that, I would like to thank you very much for giving me \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c13th October 2022                       NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                               37 \\n\\nto thank my campaign team and my family. More so, the First Lady of Yatta Madam Jackline \\nKagia.  \\n\\nKey  issues  in  my  constituency  include  the  road  infrastructure.  Yatta  has  been \\nmarginalised for long. You can imagine Hon. Temporary Speaker, we have people who have \\nnever seen a tarmac road, particularly when  you talk of the key roads: Kilimani to Katangi, \\nMatuu to Katangi and Ndalani To Makuyu. These are very essential roads to open the economy \\nto Yatta constituency.  \\nAnother  important  thing  to  recognise  is  the  cost  of  living,  which  is  above  the  roof. \\n \\nCurrently,  we  can  talk  of  maize  retailing  at  Kshs6,000  per  a  90-kilogramme  bag  in  Yatta \\nConstituency when in 2017 it was retailing at Kshs2,400. Most of the people are earning less \\nthan  a  dollar  in  a  day.  These  are  key  concerns  which  the  Government  needs  to  take  into \\nconsideration. Another important thing to factor in is the Yatta Dam. This has been a talk for \\ndecades. It is very key that we have a dam because many people will get water through it. Also \\nof key importance is the desilting of Yatta Canal which is serving so many people in Yatta. \\nToday  in  Yatta,  we  should  be  exporting  crops.  But  we  are  not  because  water  supply  is  not \\nguaranteed. \\n \\nWe need to have a Huduma Centre to support the Yatta and Masinga people. That is \\nbecause the majority of the people in Yatta and Masinga are relying on the Huduma Centre in \\nMachakos  and  they  have  to  travel  far;  a  distance  which  costs  more  than  Kshs300  one  way. \\nSomething to remember is unemployment, which has shot over the roof. Most of the youth are \\nleaving  schools  and  are  walking  with  papers,  but  there  are  no  jobs.  They  have  certificates, \\ndiplomas and degrees, but have no work. Therefore, the Government needs to take this into \\nconsideration to open the economy and absorb people who are leaving schools. We also have \\nteachers who are waiting to be employed and you can imagine someone tarmacking until they \\nare  40  years  without  being  employed.  The  only  thing  they  have  is  a  Teachers\\xe2\\x80\\x99  Service \\nCommission (TSC) number. This is something that the Government needs to reconsider. \\n \\nWith regard to title deeds in Yatta, we have thousands if not hundreds of thousands of \\npeople who are squatters and most of them need tittle deeds. We are talking of 59 years since \\nKenya attained self-rule and there are people without title deeds. The Government should take \\nthis into consideration. It is a pertinent issue in Yatta. \\n\\nSomething  that  I  want  to  bring  to  the  attention  of  the  House  is  electricity.  We  have \\nmany schools and villages without electricity. As their MP, I would love the Government to \\ntake into consideration more about the rural electrification program.  \\n\\nBack to the Motion, I want to contribute meaningfully because a Motion to do with a \\nschool feeding program is very essential. I am a beneficiary of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaziwa ya Nyayo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and our \\npupils  should  enjoy  school  feeding  programs  because  this  contributes  to  Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) 3 and 4 on Equality, Quality Education as well as Good Health \\nand Well-Being.   \\n \\nThis is a Motion I fully support. It is going to shoulder the burden that parents are going \\nthrough to be able to raise or pay for food in schools for their kids. It is also going to boost \\nretention and we cannot ignore. Therefore, this is a Motion I fully support and I hope that we \\ncan  entrench  the  school  feeding  program  in  the  NG-CDF  so  that,  at  least,  we  can  have  it \\nbudgeted and money allocated to provide food to school-going children.  \\n\\nWith those few remarks, I did not have a chance to contribute to the Presidential debate. \\nHowever, something caught my eye. When you talk about the Hustler Fund, my question is: \\nAre we trying to baptise Uwezo Fund and call it Hustler Fund? Uwezo Fund tends to serve the \\nsame function as what the Hustler Fund is intended. What was wrong with Uwezo Fund which \\nmotivated the Head of State to bring the Hustler Fund? This is something we need to look into \\nso that we can take lessons learnt from Uwezo Fund to inform the Hustlers Fund. Otherwise, it \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I rest my case. \\nThe  Temporary  Speaker  (Hon.  (Ms.)  Martha  Wangari):  Thank  you.  Member  for \\n\\nwill be a duplication of efforts by creating another Fund which will serve the same purpose and \\nfunction as the Uwezo Fund. \\n \\nOn matters to do with corruption, as a Member of Parliament, I have noticed that Kenya \\nhas slowed down on this. We have seen people accused or with standing cases of graft finding \\nthemselves  in  elective  positions  and  others  landing  in  very  juicy  appointments  in  the \\nGovernment. So, it is important for our Government to tell us what they are doing differently \\nfrom the Jubilee Government in taming matters of corruption. \\nAs  a  Member  of  Parliament,  this  is  a  key  concern  because  if  corruption  was \\n \\nmeaningfully tamed like it has been in Singapore and Finland, then Kenya would be on the \\nmove  to  be  a  proper  middle-income  economy  like  other  nations  of  the  world.  This  will \\nguarantee the people leaving school will get  employment as opposed to  what we are seeing \\ntoday, which is a serious concern to all of us. So, we need to meaningfully look into this. \\n \\nLastly, I would like to recognise the most important and outstanding issue which came \\nfrom the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech. In No.28, he said that the Government will not borrow to fund \\nrecurrent expenditure. This was a good point because it is like borrowing money from a bank \\nto  pay  rent.  So,  when  he  said  the  Government  will  not  borrow  to  invest  on  recurrent \\nexpenditure, I fully support him on this. But, please, let us reconsider other matters. Otherwise, \\nwe are not doing well as a Government.  \\nYou can imagine the debt ratio in relation to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stands \\n \\nat 67.4 per cent. This is limiting the capacity of Government to invest in development and is \\none of the key contributors to the unemployment that we are seeing; which has shot through \\nthe roof.  \\n \\n \\nNakuru County. \\nHon.

Tunaelewa kwamba ili mtoto \\naweze kusoma na kupita vizuri, anafaa kupatiwa chakula cha kutosha.  \\n \\nTunapoongea juu ya utaribu wa vile watoto wetu watalishwa, ni vizuri wapate chakula \\nambacho kinafaa ama special diet. Lazima kiwe na proteins, carbohydrates na vitamins. Kwa \\nhivyo, chakula chenyewe lazima kitoke kwa wakulima wa Kenya ambao wanalima mahindi, \\nviazi, ndengu na maharagwe. Inafaa wapatiwe nafasi ya kupeleka hicho chakula kwenye shule \\nambazo ziko katika maeneo bunge yao. \\nNachukua  nafasi  hii  kuwaambia  Waheshimiwa  tuweze  kuja  pamoja  ili  kuhakikisha \\n \\nchakula  hiki  kitatoka  kwa  wakulima  wetu  hapa  nchini.  Itakuwa  jambo  mbaya  tunapopanga \\nmpango huu wa kulisha watoto wetu, halafu chakula kitoke nchi zingine. Hatutafurahi kusikia \\nkwamba kuna chakula ambacho kimetoka nje ya hii nchi. Tunataka watoto wetu walishiwe na \\nwakulima wa hapa Kenya ambao pia ni wazazi wa hao watoto. \\n \\nHatuwezi kuongea tu mambo ya chakula. Ili mtoto aweze kupita, lazima apatiwe kila \\nkitu  ambacho  anahitaji.  Naongea  hivi  kwa  sababu  najua  saa  hii  tuko  na  masomo  mapya \\nyanayoitwa  Competency  Based  Curriculum  (CBC),  na  kuna  vitu  vingi  sana  ambavyo \\nvinahitajika.  Ili mtoto  aweze kupita baada  ya kula, anahitaji vitu vingi.  Kwa hivyo, nisharti \\nkatika mikakati ya kuhakikisha kwamba watoto wanapata chakula, waangalie ni nini watoto \\nwanahitaji ili waweze kupita. \\nNawapongeza  Wabunge  wote  waliochagulia  katika  Bunge  hili.  Najua  ili  maendeleo \\n \\nyafike pale nyumbani ni kwa sababu ya NG-CDF. Naunga mkono mambo ya NG-CDF na pesa \\nzote za Serikali kama zile zinapitia ofisi ya Mama Kaunti, Women Enterprise Fund na Youth \\nEnterprise Development Fund, ziwekwe katika Katiba. Hii ni kwa sababu hizo pesa zinasaidia \\nmwanachi wa kawaida. \\n \\nNikirudi kwa mambo ya kulisha watoto shuleni, ni lazima wakulima wa nchi ya Kenya \\nwapewe nafasi kupeleka chakula shuleni. Tunajua watoto wetu wamemaliza shule na hawana \\nkazi. Kuna watu wasiojiweza. Hta wao wapatiwe nafasi kama suppliers.  \\n\\nNachukua nafasi hii kusema nilifurahishwa sana na Hotuba ya Rais alipoongea juu ya \\nmambo  ya  agriculture.  Alisema  Serikali  ya  Kenya  Kwanza  itapunguza  bei  ya  mbolea  na \\nchochote ambacho kinahitajika ili ukulima uwe bora zaidi \\nNilifurahia sana alipoguza maisha ya mkulima nchini Kenya. Aliguzia maisha ya kila \\n \\nmtu.  Nampongeza  Rais  kwa  kutilia  maanani  mambo  aliyosema  wakati  wa  kampeini.    Kwa \\nhivyo,  sisi  wote  kama  Wabunge  tuungane  pamoja  na  kuweza  kuleta  wananchi  wawe  kitu \\nkimoja na tuangazie mahitaji yao. \\n \\nMhe.

Those people humbled \\nme as I was campaigning; where I offered myself to them and gave them the promises that I \\nwished to deliver later on in this House. They trusted me, heard my word, believed in me and \\nelected me. I would like to thank them all. \\n\\nI also take this special chance to thank my family, beginning with my husband. I heard \\nthe  woman  governor  for  some  county  struggling  to  place  her  husband  as  the  county  first \\ngentleman, and I do not know how the husbands of the Women Representatives will be referred \\nto. I do not know if it is the county man or what it is. I thank my husband for supporting me. \\n\\nI  would  like  to  thank  a  clique  of  friends,  that  is  Warembo  na  Ishu.  I  also  thank  the \\nchurch  where  some  of  the  members  stood  with  me,  prayed  for  me,  and  fasted  for  my  sake. \\nThank you so much and may God bless you. \\n\\nTurkana  County  is  placed  in  a  very  unique  position.  We  border  three  international \\nboundaries,  that  is  Ethiopia,  South  Sudan  and  Uganda.  This  puts  Turkana  in  a  very \\nadvantageous position and disadvantageous one at the same time; especially on the insecurity \\nmatters where our boundaries expose us to external aggression. The Turkana people lose lives \\nand livestock to the neighbouring countries. Even internally, we are still vulnerable. Over the \\nweekend, I came from burying very eminent members of my society that we lost to banditry. \\nTurkana  County  is  one  vulnerable  county.  This  country  has  to  take  note  of  the  unique \\nchallenges that we go through. Apart from losing lives to the internal  conflicts, the external \\nones need to  be looked into.  It is  like  fighting an international  country like Ethiopia, South \\nSudan and Uganda, and there are no members of the army deployed in those boundaries.

It is my wish that for the first time, the \\nGovernment in place today will look into the special placement of Turkana so that the army is \\ndeployed in those international boundaries. \\n\\n About the banditry, we will have discussions going forward. It has become a menace \\nas it affects many counties here. Surprisingly, the perpetrators seem to come from one specific \\nplace. That is a discussion for another day. \\n\\nOn today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Motion on school feeding programme, I want to admit that I am one of the \\nbeneficiaries of the programme. Were it not for the food in schools, I would not be here today. \\nBeing brought  from a poor county and poor family for that case,  I would only go to school \\nbecause  there  was  food.  By  good  chance,  I  got  to  learn  and  that  is  why  there  is  a  Woman \\nRepresentative for Turkana County today. A school feeding programme for those of us who \\ncome from drought-stricken counties is a key topic to be discussed. I congratulate the Member \\nof Parliament who has brought that Motion to the Floor of the House today and I support it. \\n\\nHon.  Temporary  Speaker,  as  we  speak  today,  drought  is  ravaging  our  counties, \\nespecially Turkana County. We have no land for farming. We only depend on livestock. When \\ndrought strikes, there is no pasture for our livestock. We go to nearby countries. For instance \\nnow, the Turkana people are in Uganda and South Sudan in search of pasture, and they are \\nexposed to external and international humiliation in those countries. At times, their livestock \\nremains  there  when  they  come  back  to  Kenya.  The  drought  topic  has  to  be  looked  into. \\nAlthough we cannot command rain, Kenya has to come up with ways or measures that will \\ncushion us so that next time that we have drought, we know what is supposed to be done. \\n\\nFor the school feeding program, Turkana County stands out as the most special county \\nthat needs to be fed. Not even schools alone, but even the adults. We lose people to hunger. \\nMany malnutrition cases are being reported in Turkana County. It is not about school feeding \\nalone  but,  extend  it  to  adult  feeding.  In  Turkana,  we  have  no  farms.  We  do  not  practice \\nagriculture  because  of  our  climatic  conditions.  It  is  not  our  liking.  If  we  had  good  climatic \\nconditions, and because we have expansive lands, we would be a county that is feeding this \\ncountry. But because our land is not arable, we are looking up to you people in upcountry to \\nfeed  Turkana  County  and  other  counties  like  Marsabit,  Samburu  and  some  places  in  North \\nEastern. \\n\\nI  am  so  delighted  to  speak  in  the  august  House  today  for  the  first  time  and,  going \\nforward, we will be contributing to various topics. I want to rely heavily on the promises that \\nmy party leader, the President of the Republic of Kenya, gave to Kenyans in a document called \\nThe Plan. In The Plan, all our needs have been mentioned there. All our problems have their \\nsolutions there. I know that being the action-oriented leader that he is, he will deliver.   \\n\\nWith  regards  to  the  National  Government  Affirmative  Action  Fund  (NGAAF)  for \\nvulnerable groups, I heard the President assure women leaders of this country many times that \\nhe will deliberately enhance that Fund so that it can reach out to many hustlers down there. \\nThey are still looking forward to that.   \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. God bless Kenya, God bless Turkana. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari):  Thank you. I also note that if you \\nare making your maiden speech, please inform the House. You will be heard in silence. Points \\nof order are not permitted when you are making your maiden speech. I want to make that clear, \\nbecause Hon. Raso was out of order in the first place.   \\n\\nThe next Member to speak is the Member for Keiyo South, Hon. Gideon Kimaiyo. \\nHon. George Kariuki (Ndia, UDA): On a point of order, Hon. Temporary Speaker.   \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): What is your point of order, Hon. \\n\\nGK from Ndia? \\n\\nHon.  George  Kariuki  (Ndia,  UDA):    Hon.  Temporary  Speaker,  we  have  Members \\nwho have not had an opportunity to address the House or to contribute to Motions in the House.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

So, for five hours every day, I have not had an \\nopportunity to address the House.  I request that you limit the time per Member from 10 to five \\nminutes, so that we all get an opportunity to say something. It is  unfortunate that although I \\nwas very prepared to say something or contribute to the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, I did not get an \\nopportunity, even after sitting here and waiting for five hours per day.  \\n Kindly, Hon. Temporary Speaker, limit the time per Member. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. GK. Just hold on. \\nI want to make it clear that you cannot limit the time in the middle of a Motion; that will be \\nagainst the Standing Orders. That should have been done from the start. However, I also note \\nthat there are Members who have never spoken in Parliament.  If we would be magnanimous \\nenough,  more  of  us  would  get  an  opportunity  to  speak.  That  is  why  we  have  extended  this \\nSitting up to 9.00 O\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock tonight so that we give as many Members as possible a chance to \\nspeak. When you are given a chance to speak for 10 minutes, you do not have to use all of it. \\nYou can use two or five minutes, and more Members will get a chance to talk. \\n\\n Let us go to the Member for Keiyo South, Hon. Gideon Kimaiyo. \\nHon. Gideon Kimaiyo (Keiyo South, UDA):  Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. \\nMine  is  not  a  maiden  speech,  but  I  want  to  contribute  to  the  Motion  on  the  school-feeding \\npolicy. At Independence, our forefathers talked about three problems; ignorance, disease and \\npoverty. However today, we still face the same problems. The Motion by the Hon. Member for \\nKakamega addresses the issue of education.   \\n\\nThe United Nations (UN) did some research on 10 problems that will affect humanity \\nin the next 10 years. Amongst them were education, democracy, environment, terrorism, war, \\nand water. They highlighted solutions for all these issues. Education was key in addressing all \\nthese issues. I have gone to school hungry, so I know what it took for the Member of Parliament \\n(MP) to  come up with this  Motion. It  has taken true miracles for me to  go to  school.  I was \\neducated by the late Hon. Nicholas Biwott.  I dropped out of school when I was in Form Three. \\nWhen  campaigning,  I  promised  my  constituents  that  we  will  establish  a  school-feeding \\nprogramme. So, this Motion is personal to me.   \\n\\nWhen  I  came  to  this  House  this  afternoon,  I  was  the  first  one  to  log  in.    I  was  first \\nbecause this is personal to me. As we contribute to this Motion, I hope that one day, the school-\\nfeeding  programme  will  not  only  be  an  Act  of  Parliament,  but  will  also  be  anchored  in  the \\nConstitution in such a way that when we talk about free primary education, there will be an \\nelement of food in it. This is so that we do not just talk about free primary education, yet we \\nstill have children who are suffering because there is no food. \\n\\nThere is  hunger problem in  areas of Kerio  Valley  in  Keiyo South  Constituency. We \\nthank  the  World  Vision  International  for  doing  something  about  it;  but  that  is  a  Non-\\nGovernmental Organisation (NGO). In previous Parliaments, this Motion was tabled, and the \\nGovernment shot it down because they said that there was no money to cater for it. I believe \\nthat there is money. If we can arrange to have the Government, NGOs, and the World Food \\nProgramme (WFP) come together, we can have the money to sustain this programme. This is \\na noble and timely idea.   \\n\\nLet me address the importance of this programme. One, is that we will have improved \\nperformance  in  school.  It  will  also  bring  equity.  Currently,  we  are  talking  about  the \\nCompetency Based Curriculum (CBC), but when it comes to requirements for schools to cater \\nfor  the  CBC,  children  in  private  schools  are  more  advantaged  than  those  in  public  primary \\nschools, where they cannot even afford a basic meal.  \\n\\n This programme will also improve the health of our children. We will no longer see \\nmalnourished children in places where they cannot afford food. In the long run, it will assist \\nwith  the  issue  of  poverty.  Education  will  be  an  equaliser  for  everybody,  whether  you  come \\nfrom a rich or a poor family. We are talking about hustlers in the new regime. When we talk \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It  is  a timely programme since it will address  hustlers, who \\nform the larger part of this country. Once children have food, they will concentrate more in \\nschool, and this will improve their performance.   \\n\\nWhen I was campaigning in my Constituency, I promised them this programme. I did \\nnot know that one or two weeks down the line in Parliament, this Motion would be tabled.  I \\nthank  the  MP  for  bringing  it.  I  assure  my  constituents  that  I  am  a  firm  believer  in  this \\nprogramme  to  feed  our  children  in  school.  I  ask  the  Government  to  ensure  that  schools, \\nespecially primary schools, have empty land. If we say that the school-feeding programme is \\nexpensive, we can tailor-make it in such a way that empty land in schools is used to plant maize \\nand beans, which will reduce the cost. \\n\\n In  day-secondary  schools,  a  child  pays  Ksh1,000  for  meals  every  term.  The \\nGovernment promised free day-secondary education, but they still pay Ksh9,000 per year. If \\nthis programme is introduced, it will cater for those meals, and free day-secondary schools will \\nbe a reality, and not the one that we have today where parents still go to their pockets.  \\n\\nIn my Constituency, we sat down with stakeholders in the education sector to look at \\nhow  to  make  day-secondary  schools  free  without  parents  going  to  their  pockets  to  pay  this \\nKsh1,000 every month. I believe this programme will make day-secondary schools free.  \\n\\nWith those few remarks, Hon. Temporary Speaker, I support this Motion.  \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Thank you. The next speaker will \\n\\nbe the Member for Dagoretti North, Hon. Beatrice Elachi. \\n\\nHon. Beatrice Elachi (Dagoretti North, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. \\nBefore I start, I want to congratulate you. I thank the Almighty God because as girls who were \\nmentored by Mwai Kibaki we still keep our values. \\n\\nThis is a Motion that is so dear to my heart. I want to thank Stanbic Bank for starting \\nthe  programme  in  my  constituency.  I  am  able  to  feed  Gatina  Primary  School.  We  are  still \\nnegotiating for Muslim Primary School and Kawangware Primary School as I prepare to launch \\nthe kitchen programme to feed at least 15,000 children in school every day at lunch time. I also \\nwant to thank Hon. Kiarie, Hon. Mohamed Ali, Hon. Milemba and Hon. Aseka. This team has \\nmade us proud. They are able to feed children within their constituencies. There is a wonderful \\ngirl called Wawira who right now is feeding 80,000 children across different counties. I also \\nwant  to  thank her and her Food for Education initiative. She has a vision which  I hope this \\nHouse will follow to ensure that we have food for our children. \\n\\nThe most interesting thing is that we tend to ignore the fact that when the 13 ASAL \\ncounties face hunger, Nairobi is hit so badly. And I am not saying this in bad faith. You will \\nfind children running all over shopping centres looking for food after school,  which is  very \\ndangerous.  This  programme  serves  to  retain  children  in  school.  It  also  ensures  that  we \\nsafeguard our children so that they are not used to peddle drugs. At Lavington Arcade, a child \\nis given a parcel to send to someone and they do not look inspect it because they want their \\nKsh100 to take home. Many grown-ups in Nairobi use children within shopping malls to peddle \\ndrugs. We need to deal with that. \\n\\nI want to thank Mama Elsie Muhanda, our leader and mother who has held most of us \\nfrom Kakamega together, for thinking as a mother. This is what parents need for their children. \\nTo even have good grades, you need to be fed. We know very well that when a child is hungry, \\nthat  child  will  be  so  helpless  in  class  and  will  never  concentrate.  We  should  pick  this \\nprogramme. We should look at the CDF Act and entrench it in the Constitution. The Ksh1.6 \\nbillion  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  using  should  come  through  the  constituencies  to  feed \\nchildren. If used well, that money is enough to feed nearly all children in the 290 constituencies. \\nParents will only need to subsidise maybe with Ksh5 or Ksh6. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

When \\nyou look at urban areas like Nakuru, Nairobi Kisumu and Mombasa, if we are not careful we \\nare going to lose a lot of our children. They are about to close school in the next one month. I \\nam  imagining  what  is  going  to  explode  in  Nairobi,  Nakuru,  Kisumu  and  other  urban  areas \\nwhere children will be after closing schools for two months. They will wonder what to do. \\n\\nI  know  the  regulations  on  supplying  food  were  strict,  but  I  want  to  as  the  Principal \\nSecretary  for  Special  Programmes,  Mr.  Nelson  Marwa,  to  have  mercy  on  urban  areas  and \\ndistribute food to schools. Those who are able to cook can do so in their schools. This will help \\nchildren, especially those in Standard Eight, Grade Six and Form Four who are going to do \\ntheir exams very soon. It will ensure they settle in class, concentrate and perform.  \\n\\nThis Motion is going to save all of us. I believe there is a framework already. The same \\nframework  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  using  to  disburse  Kshs1.6B  billion  is  the  same \\nframework we can enhance. We can look at the regulations and ensure they are clear to guide \\nschool feeding programme in this country. The President went to Dagoretti South when he was \\ncampaigning  and  saw  the  kitchen  programme.  I  believe  it  is  in  his  interest  and  that  of  the \\nGovernor to ensure we work together in Nairobi. I plead with legislators from other counties \\nto work together with county assemblies to ensure we feed our children.  \\n\\nIf we can ensure we retain children in school, we can then deal with the parents. For \\nnow, it is so difficult to talk to a parent who is about to sleep hungry. That is why you meet a \\nchild in a shopping centre at 9 or 10 o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock at night. When you pick and take them to their \\nhouse,  you  realise  they  were  going  to  sleep  hungry  because  they  had  nothing.  It  is  not  that \\npeople are taking advantage, but there is a big challenge in the country brought by drought and \\nCovid-19 pandemic. Many Kenyans are sleeping hungry. \\n\\nHon.  Temporary  Speaker,  with  those  few  remarks,  I  beg  to  support.  Thank  you  and \\n\\ncongratulations. \\n\\nHon. Beatrice Elachi (Dagoretti North, ODM): Thank you for your kind words. The \\nnext speaker will be the Member for Kieni, Hon. Anthony Wainaina. If he is not in the House, \\nthe chance will go to the Member for Bureti Hon. Kibet Komingoi. \\n\\nHon. Kibet Komingoi (Bureti, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. I think \\nit is easier to please voters in Kenya than to please the Speaker. I have been here for several \\ndays,  waiting  for  a  chance  to  speak  and  make  my  maiden  speech.  I  thank  you  for  this \\nopportunity. \\n\\nIt pleased God and the people of Bureti to elect me. I am very grateful to the people of \\nBureti  in  all  the  wards\\xe2\\x80\\x94Tebesonik,  Cheboin,  Kapkatet,  Cheplanget,  Chemosot,  Litein  and \\nKisiara\\xe2\\x80\\x94who gave us an overwhelming victory to be in this Parliament. \\n\\nI will not belabour the point. I want to talk about the issues that we will be addressing \\nin Bureti. Some of them were covered in the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech. Bureti Constituency is one of \\nthe  constituencies  with  no  tap  water.  We  will  be  looking  forward  to  implementation  of  the \\nwater projects promised by the Kenya Kwanza team.  \\n\\nTwo, we are looking forward to  engaging on construction of infrastructure in  Bureti \\nConstituency.  There  are  roads  that  need  to  be  tarmacked,  including  Chebwagan-Kabala, \\nBoguiyot-Kapkisiara  and  Chelilis-Ketarwet-Charera  roads.  We  hope  in  five  years,  this \\ngovernment will see these developments through. On education, we hope that the government \\nwill reconsider some of its plans because the teachers of Bureti have been asking me. I am sure \\nsome of you Members have also received the same sentiments about the abuse or the failed \\ndelocalisation programmes. We are hoping that teachers will be sent back to their communities \\nto teach there and retire from their homes.  \\nThirdly, we have issues of the urban areas of Bureti. For all the programmes that will \\n \\nbe set out within the plan, we are praying and hoping in the hustler and the bottom-up approach \\nthat the UDA Party and the Kenya Kwanza Government is seeking to implement.. We hope it \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

One of the critical  things we  are looking into is \\ndecriminalisation of work so that we may have all people doing whatever is legal in order to \\nearn  a  living.  One  of  the  things  we  are  seeking  and  will  want  in  the  health  sector  is  the \\nupgrading of the Kapkatet District Hospital. We want the upgrading of drainages at Kapkatet \\ntowns and the Kapkatet Stadium, which we have been looking into for several years.  \\n \\nAbout the Motion on the table,  I support school  feeding programme.  I  am  hearing  a \\nmisnomer about drought in various regions. While there are places in this country that are not \\nfacing drought, they are still facing food shortages. In our villages, however much we say we \\nreceive rains in Kericho and its environs, there are homes and people who sleep without food. \\nWe  must  also  consider  this  -  providing  food  and  creating  investments  in  agriculture  so  that \\nfood is provided. On the food programme, my submission is that we give priority to food grown \\nwithin the regions so that we do not import food for the children we are seeking to feed in our \\nschools. \\nI agree with the Hon. Member for Dagoretti North, that included in the basic primary \\n \\neducation should be the feeding programme. The feeding programme should also be included \\nin  National  Government  Constituency  Development  Fund  (NG-CDF)  programmes  that  we \\nhave so as to carter for the disadvantaged in communities. One thing we must understand is \\nthat however  rich communities may be, or however wet  lands may be because they  receive \\nrainfall,  there  are  pockets  of  people  in  our  societies  who  are  experiencing  deficits  on  food. \\nThere are people who are actually poor that they cannot afford food for their children and for \\nthemselves.  It  is  our submission that this Motion be approved so that we see how it  can be \\nimplemented.  \\n \\nFinally, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to give this maiden speech, and to \\nremind ourselves to let justice and fairness be the guiding principle in our debates. Let the time \\nfor logging in also matter so that we do not have people sitting here for too long before they \\nget an opportunity to speak. Otherwise, Hon. Temporary Speaker, thank you very much.   \\n \\nwill be the Member for Khwisero, Hon. Christopher Aseka. \\nHon.  Christopher  Wangaya  (Khwisero,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary \\n \\nSpeaker, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this Motion. First, let me congratulate \\nyou for being part of the Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Panel. I congratulate our Speaker, Hon. Moses Wetangula, \\nand the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Gladys Boss Shollei. Let me also take this opportunity to thank \\nthe great people of Khwisero Constituency for giving me an opportunity to serve them for the \\nsecond term. Since Khwisero was hived off from Butere in 1997, through the grace of God, I \\nam  the  first  privileged  Member  of  Parliament  to  be  re-elected  to  this  august  House.  My \\ncommitment to them and my priority remains to support our education sector to see to it that \\nour children get better out of every programme.  \\n \\nThe school feeding programme is real and happening in Khwisero. I initiated it in 2018, \\nwhen we realised that economic and social challenges facing our people were spilling over to \\nour children. We came up with a basic meal of maize and beans for all candidates in all public \\nprimary schools. It is not easy; it is something that requires a lot of attention and it has serious \\nfinancial implications. But, as a Christian, we say service to humanity is service to God.  \\nHon. Temporary Speaker, I will only share the positives we have witnessed in Khwisero \\n \\nfor the last five years. The rate of school attendance went up, especially for the candidates. The \\ncontact hours between teachers and pupils increased because you only need 30 minutes to serve \\nlunch  in  a  day,  and  save  another  45  minutes  for  some  other  supportive  activities.  This  has \\nenabled teachers to go through their syllabus revision. We have seen improved performance in \\nour schools.                                 \\n\\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Hon. Members, the next speaker \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The \\n \\nattendance and the concentration in class has gone up. We have been able to transit as many \\nstudents as possible from primary to secondary schools. It has also made burdens on parents \\neasier. At times in the villages every afternoon, as you know, every woman and father needs to \\ngo  back  home  and  prepare  lunch  for  their  children.  If  we  have  this  programme  in  schools, \\nparents will utilise that time in some more profitable economic activities. \\n \\nLastly, so that I allow new Members to make their maiden speeches, Members have \\nargued about the sustainability of this programme. It is about strategy on how to do it. What \\nwe are doing from next year is capitalising on our primary schools. As a foundation, we are \\ngiving  inputs  those  that  have  big  tracts  and  chunks  of  land.  We  are  supporting  them  with \\nfertilisers and certified seeds so that they produce within the schools. We are also reaching out \\nto NGOs to come in and support.  \\n \\nAs I finish, let us align and translate this Motion into an Act of Parliament. Despite the \\nfinancial challenges and problems within the country, we can allow and open up the NG-CDF \\nAct through the amendment we want to bring to the Floor. That will allow us to spend on this \\nrecurrent expenditure over and above the infrastructure that we are doing. Then every MP will \\nhave a provision to budget for this noble programme within the NG-CDF.  \\n \\nLastly, I promise the people of Khwisero that infrastructural developments in schools \\nwill continue. In collaboration with the national and county government, I will prioritise putting \\nup  a  Khwisero  Level  Four  hospital,  and  operationalisation  of  the  Khwisero  Technical  and \\nTraining Institute.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Hon. Member, thank you for your \\n\\n \\ncompliments.  \\n\\nThe next speaker will be the Member for West Pokot County, Hon. Rael Kasiwai.   \\nHon. Rael Kasiwai (West Pokot County, KUP): Thank you for this golden opportunity \\n \\nto make my first speech in Parliament since independence. I congratulate the Speaker, Hon. \\nMoses Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula, and the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Gladys Boss, in absentia, for their election. \\nI believe in them and they are going to deliver in the 13th Parliament. I also want to congratulate \\nyou  for  carrying  out  the  days\\xe2\\x80\\x99  programme.  I  am  a  Christian  and  a  strong  Catholic  for  that \\nmatter. Therefore, I thank the Almighty God for giving me and all of us good health and for \\nthe peaceful elections. It was the most peaceful election ever.  \\n\\nI  thank  the  people  of  West  Pokot  for  overwhelmingly  voting  me  as  their  County \\nMember of Parliament; more so, the people of Kacheliba, Sigor, South Pokot and Kapenguria \\nconstituencies. I want to promise them that I am going to serve them diligently and with a lot \\nof dedication.  \\n\\nI also want to thank all my fellow teachers in my county. They supported me because \\nthey had a lot of confidence in me. Wherever they are, I promise that I am going to support \\nMotions that promote education. Our county is one of those marginalised counties where the \\ngirl child is still not considered important. I promised the women of West Pokot that I am going \\nto work hard to ensure that the economy goes up using the NGAAF. Although the NGAAF \\nissue is a real problem because it has very little money, we hope that the current Government \\nis going to do something about it. This is because the women, youth and people living with \\ndisabilities are the majority in our society, yet they are given very little money. I want to urge \\nWomen Members of Parliament in this House to urge the President to do something about it. \\nThose people expect so much from us, and yet the money allocated to us is very little.  \\n\\nWest Pokot is one of the counties with many challenges. In the media, you saw that it \\nis one of the counties hard hit by drought. Although we have two sub counties doing farming, \\nthe other two \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Sigor and Kacheliba constituencies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are arid areas. People living in those two \\nconstituencies are pastoralists because they cannot do farming due to lack of rain. So, they have \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It has resulted to \\ninsecurity  and  conflicts  with  the  neighbouring  communities  as  they  compete  for  the  same \\nresources. I hope that the President is going to do something on the same so that my people in \\nthose two constituencies are assisted.  \\n\\n I want to thank the Hon. Member who came up with this Motion. As I said earlier, I \\nam a teacher by profession. So, the Member had teachers and my county in mind. That is where \\nthere is real problem of school dropouts due to lack of food in schools. I would like to support \\nthe Motion tabled by the Member.  I am  a beneficiary of this programme which was there a \\nlong time ago, like the Nyayo Milk. That milk was very sweet. It made us look forward to going \\nto school. I do not know where the rain started beating us that caused such programmes to stop. \\nI thank this House because everybody who has spoken is supporting it.  \\n\\nThe school feeding programmes have a lot of benefits to our schools. One of them being \\nretention of learners in schools. In West Pokot County, children go to school because of that \\nfood.  Sometimes  it  is  given  by  the  WFP  and  other  NGOs.  But  that  amount  of  food  is  not \\nenough. So, it can be given for two to three days and then it gets finished. Children then go \\nback home to stay. Another importance of having these programmes in schools is that it reduces \\ninfamous behaviours in children, such as stealing from each other. When children are given the \\nsame amount of food and all of them are fed uniformly, there will be no stealing on the premise \\nthat others have while others may not have food.  \\n\\nBy giving meals in schools, the performance in examinations will improve. Children \\nare  going  to  be  in  school  most  of  their  time.  They  will  have  enough  time  to  revise,  hence \\nimproving their results. I have practically seen it, and it is the reason why I support this Motion. \\nIt also helps those learners from poor households to go to school. In West Pokot County, most \\nparents  do not have food due to  poor rains.  So,  having  food in  schools  will help  keep such \\nchildren in schools.  \\n\\nThe school feeding programmes will tremendously improve the health of learners. We \\nall know that a healthy nation is a wealthy nation. Malnutrition could be done away with hence \\nwe  shall  have  a  healthy  nation  in  the  long  run.  The  school  feeding  programme  has  a  lot  of \\nimportance and I cannot mention all of them. I hope we will fully implement it. I hope we are \\nnot just going to debate about it and leave it here. We hope the Government will do something \\nso that this programme is fully implemented in our schools to ensure our children go to school.  \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Hon. Member, your time is up. The \\n\\nnext speaker is the nominated Member, Hon. Suleka Harun. \\n\\nHon.  Suleka  Harun  (Nominated,  UDM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker  for \\ngiving me this opportunity. First, allow me to congratulate the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker \\nfor their election in this House, and also your election as a Member of the Chairpersons\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Panel. \\nHon. Temporary Speaker, I am new to this House courtesy of the United Democratic \\nMovement  (UDM)  party.  I  thank  them  for  having  trust  me,  and  nominating  me  to  this  13th \\nParliament. Additionally, it will not be fair if I do not express my gratitude to the electorates \\nwho elected a good number of MPs to this House. Were it not for their support, I would not \\nhave  been  here  today.  In  the  same  regard,  I  understand  that  I  am  the  first  woman  to  be \\nnominated to this House from Mandera County, and I take pride in that. \\n\\nI would like to support the Motion on the development of the school feeding policy to \\nsupport the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efforts in ensuring that there is increased access, retention, transition \\nand completion rate across the country, especially in the ASALs. I believe that school meals \\nwill be a major priority.  The school meals programme provides students with nutritional meals \\nthat children need to develop and stay healthy in schools. For many children, a school meal is \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

If well-balanced, these meals can eliminate the negative health \\neffects. These school meals are prepared by locals and this helps the children to stay connected \\nto  their  local  cultures.  They  also  provide  support  to  local  farmers.  The  best  school  meal \\nprogrammes are community-based, as they provide financial support to the local farmers. In \\ndoing so, they help generate economic activities, they allow farmers to improve their operations \\nand  expand  their  local  agriculture.  They  also  ensure  that  children  receive  fresh  and  healthy \\nnutrients on a daily basis. \\n\\nIt is also evident that food security has influence on the participation of nomadic pupils \\nin schools as well as improving their learning outcomes.  To celebrate and sustain these efforts, \\nI  support  the  development  of  the  school  feeding  policy  that  will  give  a  structured  and \\nsustainable delivery of these interventions. My prayer is that we do not leave it at this, but make \\nsure that this is implemented. This policy is of great importance to our children and we cannot \\nleave it at this. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. Member.  \\nNext is the Member for Seme, Hon. (Dr.) James Nyikal. \\nHon.  (Dr.)  James  Nyikal  (Seme,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker,  for \\ngiving me this opportunity. I also take this opportunity to congratulate you for being appointed \\nto the Chairpersons\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Panel. I appreciate the effort you are making in getting our new Members \\nto speak. The panel is doing well. As it has been the practice, even when you became a Member, \\nmy suggestion would be to advise the Members to come as early as possible and key in, and \\nthen  you  follow  that  order.  If  that  does  not  work,  at  least  Members  will  feel  that  it  is  their \\nclocking in time that matters, not just your choice. That is just a by-the-way. \\n\\nOn  this,  I  have  waited  this  long,  because  I  want  to  support  this  Motion.  As  a \\npaediatrician,  I  not  only  see  this  as  an  educational  problem,  but  as  a  child  health  and \\ndevelopment problem. This is because at the early stages that this occurs, particularly in early \\nchildhood  and  early  primary  education,  the  child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  nutrition  is  extremely  important.  For \\nexample, the growth of the brain is vital at that time.  After that time, even with good nutrition, \\nthe growth would have stopped and, therefore, the children will not benefit. We should target \\nchildren at this stage. In fact, their cognitive functions will improve. Their performance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not \\nonly in exams, but also later in life \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is significantly changed if there is good nutrition at this \\nstage in life. Not only that.  It is important even for their physical  growth. If there is lack of \\nnutrition  at  this  early  stage,  children  experience  stunted  growth,  particularly  the  female \\nchildren. When they get to puberty, they fail to have proper development growth with a lot of \\nobstetrical problems that they may face later on. I do not see this as an educational problem \\nonly, but  also  as a health problem  during the  critical  stage of  growth  and development  of a \\nchild. \\n\\nHon. Temporary Speaker, it is also of educational value, because if young children are \\nnot  well  fed,  they  have  shorter  attention  span;  their  blood  sugar  goes  low  and  they  cannot \\nfunction. So, they will be wasting time in schools if they are not properly fed. Proper meals are \\nextremely important to them. \\n\\nI support this because it is a practice that has been going on in this country. For the last \\n30 years, there has been disjointed attempts at school feeding programmes, and the Government \\nhas particularly concentrated on ASALs, where there is food insecurity. But again, to a large \\nextent, this has been done by NGOs, particularly the WFP. This programme covers about 1.2 \\nmillion children. However, this is not done in a structured manner. The Government spends up \\nto about Kshs.1.8 billion a year on this, but again not in a structured manner. You may be aware \\nthat  there  have  been  efforts  to  look  at  this  issue  in  a  more  integrated  manner  by  having \\ncommunity participation and home-grown solutions. However, this has not taken place. Why \\nhas this programme been on and off for 30 years? All of us have praised the Nyayo school milk \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The  problem  is  that  there  was  no  policy  foundation  or  a \\nbacking in law. Had that happened, the programme would still be going on.  \\nThis is an important function that will include both the national and county governments \\n \\nas  we  look  at  the  policy,  that  should  be  taken  into  consideration.  This  is  because,  the  most \\nserious implementation will involve the Early Childhood Development and Education (ECDE), \\nwhich is a county function; whereas the primary schools are a national Government function. \\nSo, there will be need for very serious coordination in this programme.  \\n\\nThis is particularly important for us, since we have episodes of food scarcity and food \\ninsecurity, like what is happening now.  Unfortunately for children, when one misses just one \\nlesson at a critical point of their education \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for example, if this happens when they are studying \\nalgebra and the child is not able to go to school or to feed properly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even if they come back to \\nschool, it takes them too long to catch up. As you know, education is incremental. You build \\non  what  you  learnt  earlier.  If  you  missed  something,  you  cannot  catch  up.    It  is  extremely \\nimportant that this is done. \\nThis is why  I came to support this and I congratulate Hon. Muhanda.  If this Motion \\n \\npasses, I urge her to follow up on it. You and I have been in this House and have passed many \\nMotions,  but  you  know  that  very  few  are  implemented.  We  even  have  the  Committee  on \\nImplementation, but we do not see implementation. Therefore, for a keen Member like her, I \\nurge her to take this matter up and follow up on the policy to implementation. She should not \\njust leave it at policy level, but she should also bring it as a Sessional Paper back to this House.  \\nThe House will then discuss it and approve it.  After that, we can make it into law. It needs one \\ncommitted person as she is. When we have it like that, it is something that will be part and \\nparcel of the education  programme  which will be integrated, even in  national  development. \\nThe  food  that  we  buy  for  the  children  to  eat  should  come  from  our  farmers.  That  can  be \\nintegrated. We say that we should use the land in schools to produce food. That can also be \\nintegrated. You can see how broad this matter is. So, we need a policy, a sessional paper and \\neventually a law that will have the content, programmes and even the monetary part. \\n \\nWith those remarks, I, once again thank you. I know that it is stressing to get our new \\ncolleagues, but we would also like to make contribution. You can always get a balance, and I \\nthink you have done it well.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. I support the Motion.   \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. Member for your \\n\\ncompliment.  \\n\\nThe next chance will go to the Member for Othaya, Hon. Michael Wambugu Wainaina. \\nHon.  Michael  Wainaina  (Othaya,  UDA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker  for \\ngiving me this chance to speak to my people, who elected me overwhelmingly. First, I thank \\nthe people of Othaya Constituency for granting me this opportunity to serve them in this House. \\nI commit to work with them to make Othaya great. It is a Constituency that has its part in the \\nhistory of Kenya for being home of the third President of Kenya, His Excellency Mwai Kibaki. \\nMay his soul rest in eternal peace. As a way of honouring his input in this nation, I will work \\nextra  hard  to  ensure  that  Othaya  will  be  a  model  constituency  where  all  will  have  equal \\nopportunities.  Let  me  congratulate  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker,  and  all  the  Members  on \\nbeing elected to come to this House.  \\n\\nI will talk about the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech. Let me start by congratulating the President and \\nhis  Deputy  for  their  well-deserved  victory.  Having  gone  through  the  speech,  I  want  to  talk \\nabout  the commitment to  implement  pledges,  and commitments which are set  out  in  Kenya \\nKwanza Manifesto. First, I look forward to seeing farmers, more so from Othaya, benefitting \\nfrom the plan which was laid out by our President in agriculture. Our significant intervention \\nis towards greater production with investment in irrigation water for the small-scale tea farmers \\nto scale up our productivity in agriculture.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

There is also a provision to access to cheap and sustainable funding for the targeted \\npopulation. Equally, the commitment by the President to inject Ksh50 billion to the Hustler \\nFund per year to enable small-scale traders to access affordable credit will go a long way in \\ncreating employment opportunities to our youth.  \\n\\nThe President committed to restructure National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF). This \\nwill liberate Kenyans and their families from the threat of becoming poor every time a family \\nmember falls ill. I also concur with the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework to improve \\nour current infrastructure.  \\n\\nIn conclusion, I commit to support the Kenya Kwanza agenda in the House by bringing \\nlegislative proposals that are in line with our plan, and also help in making the lives of Kenyans \\nbetter. \\n \\nHon.  Temporary  Speaker,  I  support  this  Motion  on  the  Development  of  a  School \\nFeeding Policy.  I know how people are suffering in  my home area. When  I was in  primary \\nschool,  I  suffered  because  of  going  to  school  without  food.  I  know  how  those  people  are \\nsuffering and why we are there. This House can do a lot to save the lives of those people. My \\nconstituency has never experienced this kind of drought. Half of the people in my constituency \\nare suffering because they eat one meal a day.  \\n\\nWe need to support this Motion because people used to get food in schools in the 1970\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nand before. Kenya is growing, and we are where we are today. We need to support this Motion. \\nI saw some children going to school with some food and others without. That is why we are \\ngetting problems in our area. I support this Motion on Development of a School Feeding Policy, \\nso that those children who come from poor backgrounds can get food at school. \\n\\nI support this Motion. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. Member.  \\nThe next Member will be the Member for Kitui West, Hon. Edith Nyenze. \\nHon.  Edith  Nyenze  (Kitui  West, WDM):  Thank you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker,  for \\ngiving me this opportunity to contribute. Let me take this opportunity to first thank God for \\nbeing re-elected the second time. Let me also thank the people of Kitui West  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Mutonguni, \\nKauwi,  Kwamutonga/Kithumula,  and  Matinyani  wards  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  for  re-electing  me.  As  I  promised \\nwhen I was campaigning, I will serve them with integrity and dedication. \\n\\nLet  me  also  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker, \\ntogether  with  your  team  for  this  opportunity  which  you  have  been  given  to  be  in  the \\nChairperson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Panel. I served with you in a Committee, and I am sure that you will deliver. \\n\\nLet  me congratulate Hon. Elsie Muhanda for the good Motion on Development  of a \\nSchool Feeding Policy. Let me also contribute briefly on the School Feeding Programme which \\nwas identified from the 1980\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, to address, in short-term, the hunger in some areas. It worked \\nvery well, but it has not  been consistent. It is very useful in ensuring that the pupils get the \\nnutrients  which  they  require  so  much.  In  so  doing,  they  become  attentive  in  school.  It  also \\nensures that the students go to school because they know they will be fed. That improves their \\nperformance  and makes  the work of the teachers easy. They teach pupils who are well fed, \\nhealthy, happy and attentive. Without food, it will be difficult for teachers to even cover the \\nsyllabus, and also for the students to concentrate in school.  \\n\\nThe School feeding programmes should support the Government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goal of education \\nfor all. There is almost 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary schools but with very \\npoor performance. We cannot talk of that transition and education for all if there is no food, \\nespecially in the ASAL areas. The school feeding programmes should target these areas and \\nensure that there is equality in our country. All children sit for the same examinations, yet some \\ncome  from  disadvantaged  areas  that  do  not  have  food.  This  means  there  is  no  equity.  The \\nGovernment should, therefore, have a programme for distributing food to the needy.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Sometimes fruits rot in farms and milk goes to waste because they are in excess. If there \\nwere good programmes, the food could be transported to the ASAL areas by the Government \\nduring harvesting season. Foods such as maize and beans  can be used to feed school  going \\nchildren. Similarly, we have areas that experience flooding, yet there are areas that do not have \\nwater.  The  Government  could  store  this  water,  store  food  and  initiate  good  plans  and \\nprogrammes to support people in disadvantaged regions. Efficient school feeding programmes \\ncan be done through proper policies, plans and Acts of Parliament.  \\n\\nI come from Kitui County, which is currently experiencing famine. It was reported two \\nweeks ago that four people died from hunger. This poses a threat not only to the school-going \\nchildren, but also to all people in general. I urge the Government to do something about it. We \\nsay it is good to be given the fishing rod and not the fish, but right now, we need fish in my \\ncounty, Ukambani in general and in other ASAL areas. The need is so urgent that we do not \\nhave to wait to see people die. As an MP, I distributed food to all the primary schools through \\nmy NGO.  I have 125 primary schools where I distributed maize and beans, but it is not enough. \\nDue to food scarcity, I have kept on urging teachers to work in partnership with the alumni of \\nthe schools, and contribute money to buy food, especially for primary schools. This however, \\nis not forthcoming because they are not empowered because of unemployment. This is a big \\nproblem. I urge the Government to come up with plans to embed the school feeding programme \\nin  the  NG-CDF.  We  are  the  ones  dealing  with  education  which  will  be  complete  with  this \\nprogramme.  In  doing  so,  the  performance  in  all  the  schools  will  improve.  I  also  urge  the \\nGovernment to declare hunger as a national disaster, to get assistance from various quarters. \\n \\n\\n[The Temporary Speaker (Hon. \\nMartha Wangari) left the Chair] \\n\\n[The Temporary Speaker (Hon. \\n\\nOmboko Milemba) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Some countries, more so the Asian countries like Dubai do not get rains. They can stay \\nfor years without rainfall. For us, if we go for two to three years, we experience famine. The \\nAsian countries, just like us, have plenty of minerals. We should have alternative sources of \\nresources and means to feed our country besides rainfall, since it is scarce.  \\n\\nHon. Temporary Speaker, with  those  remarks,  I  support the Hon. Member\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Motion \\n\\nbecause it is timely.  \\n\\nAbdirahman. Proceed. \\n\\nThank you. \\nThe  Temporary  Speaker  (Hon.  Omboko  Milemba):  Next  is  Hon.  Mohammed \\n\\nHon.  Abdirahman  Mohamed  (Lafey,  JP):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker.  I \\nthank the almighty God, who gave me this opportunity to be in the august House. I also thank \\nthe  great  people  of  Lafey  Constituency  for  having  faith  in  me,  and  for  the  overwhelming \\nsupport they accorded me to represent them in the 13th Parliament of the Republic of Kenya.  \\n My  constituency  has  various  challenges,  with  security  being  the  major  challenge \\nbecause we border Somalia. This week, we had three terror incidences, the latest being early \\nyesterday morning in a place called Alungu. There was a terrorist attack at the Safaricom mast, \\nand one Kenya Police Reservist (KPR) was injured in the attack. We are yet to hear from the \\ncounty and regional security team  condemning the attack and assuring the residents of their \\nsafety. We urge the Government to move very fast to bring a lasting solution to this security \\nissue. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Temporary Speaker, I urge Government to develop a proper welfare for the KPR. \\nThis is because they are neither paid well nor insured, and yet they are in the frontline of the \\nterror and insecurity.   \\n\\nLafey Constituency is the only one that does not have a single tarmac road. It also has \\npoor electricity connectivity. It is the only one  which has headquarters with a population of \\nmore than 10,000 households, yet electricity is only connected to 200 households. That is how \\nserious it is.   A month ago, they  connected 197  households, and when  I  went  to the Kenya \\nPower (KP) to request for the other households to be connected, I was told that the meters were \\nout of stock. \\n\\n I come from an undeveloped constituency and soon, I will be bringing Statements and \\nMotions. I will urge the Members to support me, because the Constituency is lagging behind. \\nIt is a Constituency without a tarmack road, with scarcity of water and a lot of health issues in \\nthis century.  \\n\\nI want to thank the Member for coming up with this Motion, which is timely and at the \\nhour of need. The majority of the Lafey Constituency residents are pastoralist, and we are in a \\ndire drought  situation.  If we pass  this Motion, it will benefit the residents  of  Lafey because \\ntheir children will be considered for feeding programmes in their schools. This is because the \\nchildren walk for long distances to reach their destined schools, yet they do not get meals in \\nschool. \\n\\nWith those few remarks, I am in support of this Motion. Thank you. \\nHon. Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Farah Maalim): Very  well.  Next  is  Hon. Gichimu \\n\\nGithinji, the Member for Gichugu Constituency. \\n\\nHon. Gichimu Githinji (Gichungu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. Let \\nme start by appreciating and congratulating the leadership of this House, led by Hon. Moses \\nMasika Wetangula, the Speaker of the National Assembly; the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Boss; the \\nsix Chairpersons of the Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Panel who are also equal to the task; and the leadership of \\nthe House, both from the Majority and Minority sides. \\n\\nHon.  Temporary Speaker, being the first time I am contributing in the 13th Parliament, \\nlet me take this early opportunity to thank the great people of Gichugu Constituency who saw \\nit fit that I should come back to Parliament to represent them for a second consecutive term.  \\nThis shows that they have trust and confidence in my leadership. I promise them that I will not \\nlet them down. I will continue serving them with vigor and love for every part of Gichugu so \\nthat the constituency can move forward. I received overwhelming, support from  all the five \\nwards of Gichugu, namely Karumandi, Baragwi Kabare, Njukiini and Ngariama. I thank you \\nall.  \\n\\nLet me assure my constituents that I will continue to lobby for the completion of the \\non-going projects.  We have Musibi, the belt of Gichugu, which is a 95-kilometre road that I \\nstarted pushing when I got into Parliament. It has already started, and I will continue lobbying \\nfor  it.    There  is  also  the  issue  of  water  and,  of  course,  we  are  also  hoping  for  electricity \\nconnectivity, both from the national level and partnering with the county Government.  I am \\npushing  for  new  and  incomplete  projects.  I  was  able  to  move  Gichugu  from  60  per  cent \\nconnectivity to about 80 per cent. I am very optimistic that in this term, we might hit 90 or 100 \\nper cent. \\n\\nGoing back to  the Motion at  hand by the able Hon. Member for Kakamega County, \\nHon. Elsie Muhanda who has proved to be a motherly legislator... She is actually looking at \\nthe needs of our children in school, and that is the core of this nation, both at the present and \\nin the future.   Looking at the Motion, it seeks for the development of a policy. Going by the \\ncontributors who have already contributed ahead of me, this Motion is receiving overwhelming \\nsupport from all the Members who have contributed, I included, because I am supporting it. I \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It comes at a time when the President, His Excellency William \\nSamoei Ruto, pronounced himself yesterday at a function in Eastlands, where he had gone to \\nsee to the needs of the Education Sector. He said that he is committed to double the Feeding \\nProgramme Fund \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which now stands at about Ksh2 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to Ksh4 billion. This is a Motion \\nthat is already receiving political goodwill. I believe that with the able President we have, it \\nwill be effected, and we will be able to embed it into law.  We shall align it with other needs \\nthat will come with the other laws that we are trying to protect under the Constitution. \\n\\n My colleague the Member for Matungulu,  Hon. Mule and  I, have already  taken the \\nlead, which is receiving an overwhelming support, because it is a common agenda to have the \\nNG-CDF embedded in the Constitution so that busy bodies will never try to distract the funds \\nthat help this country and the children. We believe that with the able President that we have, \\nthis will be effected. So, we should embed it in law and align it with the other needs that will \\ncome with other laws we are trying to protect under the Constitution.  \\n\\nMy colleague  and Member for Matungulu,  Hon. Mule and  I, have already  taken the \\nlead and it is receiving overwhelming support. This is because it is a common agenda to have \\nthe  National  Government  Constituencies  Development  Fund  (NG-CDF)  embedded  in  the \\nConstitution so that busy bodies will never come again to try and divert funds which usually \\nhelp the children of this country. \\n \\nThis  Motion,  if  passed,  will  enable  the  Government  to  set  aside  some  funds  in  the \\nbudgetary allocation under the Ministry of Education. It can well be tied with NG-CDF as a \\nsupplementary component, just like we do in matters of infrastructure, national administration \\nand security, which are under the national Government.  \\n \\nI  believe  Kenyans  should  not  worry  because  the  NG-CDF  Act,  which  was  declared \\nunconstitutional, was the 2013 Act which allowed those funds to be used in any form, including \\nthe  devolved  functions.  In  the  2015  amendments,  the  Fund  was  aligned  with  the  national \\nGovernment functions like education, national Government administration and security. This \\nis exactly what is being done through NG-CDF. If one was to do a proposal that goes against \\nthose lines in matters that are devolved, that proposal cannot pass the board level of NG-CDF. \\n \\nIf this Motion goes through - and I am optimistic it will - if there are any funds that will \\nbe allocated under the program, I propose they should be decentralised to the constituency level \\ninstead of being left at the national level. This is because if those funds are left at the national \\nlevel, there will be scramble for those resources.  \\n \\nOnce it is decentralised at the constituency level, every Member of Parliament knows \\nthe needs of each and every child. Again, this should be capped to the number of children so \\nthat we do not all receive the same amount of money and yet, our needs are different. That is \\nbecause those are funds that will support individual children and not the area. Also, secondary \\nschools  can  benefit  from  this  program  because  basic  education  covers  them.  So,  that  way, \\nsecondary  schools  which  we  have  been  supporting  with  the  feeding  program  can  also  be \\ncovered. \\n \\n \\nFred Ikana, Member for Shinyalu Constituency. \\n \\nHon.

Musalia  Mudavadi  ambaye  pia  ni  baba  wangu  wa \\nkisiasa. \\n \\nNikisha maliza kuwashukuru hao, ningependa kuwahakikishia wananchi wa Shinyalu \\nkwamba wakati wa kampeini, niliwapatia ahadi na nitazitilia mkazo. Nitahakikisha kwamba \\nnimezitekeleza,  kutumia  nguvu  zangu  zote  pamoja  na  ule  ushawishi  ambao  nafasi  hii  ya \\nkuwaakilisha katika Bunge hili la Kitaifa itanipatia. \\n \\nKwanza kabisa, katika sehemu yetu ya Shinyalu, tuko na changamoto kubwa ya miundo \\nmsingi. Unafahamu kwamba katika nchi hii yetu ya Kenya, ni miji tu mikubwa ambayo iko na \\nbarabara nzuri na safi. Huko Shinyalu hatuna barabara ya rami. Nataka nilitilie mkazo barabara \\nya kutoka pale kiwanja cha ndege hadi kuingia pale Rondo - Ireo hadi Chepsonoi. Kando na \\nmambo ya barabara, nitakuwa nakitilia mkazo mambo ya masomo ili turekebishe na kukarabati \\nmadarasa  yetu.  Pia  kuhakisha  kwamba  wanafunzi  wetu  wanasoma  katika  shule  ambazo  ni \\nnadhifu. \\n \\nKando na mambo ya masomo, ningependa pia kutilia mkazo mambo ya usambazaji wa \\nnguvu za umeme kwa sababu maeneo mengi katika eneo langu la Bunge la Shinyalu hayana \\nstima.

Next is the Member for Roysambu, Augustine Mwafrika. \\n \\nHon. Kamande Mwafrika (Roysambu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker, \\nfor giving me this glorious opportunity to address this House called the National Assembly; \\nformerly the Legislative Council of Kenya (LegCo).  \\n \\nAllow me to start by thanking our Almighty God for giving our country a very peaceful \\nand smooth  transition  during the last  general  elections.  I also  take this opportunity to  thank \\nKenyans for electing my presidential candidate, Dr. William Samoei Ruto, as the 5th President \\nof the Republic of Kenya. I also congratulate the Speaker, Hon. Moses Masika Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula, \\nand his Deputy for their election in this House. I also wish to congratulate you on the privilege \\nto sit in on their behalf. I would like to most sincerely thank the great people of Roysambu for \\ndemonstrating confidence in me and electing me as their Member of Parliament. God works in \\na  miraculous  way.  This  was  my  fourth  time  to  contest.  The  first  time  I  contested  to  be  a \\ncouncillor  in  Makongeni  in  1992,  I  did  not  win.  I  then  contested  to  be  the  Member  of  the \\nCounty Assembly (MCA) for Githurai and failed. I thought that the seat was too low for me. I \\ndecided to vie for the position of the Member of Parliament. I vied in 2017, but I did not win. \\nI told my predecessor: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have defeated me in 2017. Find me in 2022.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This time round he \\nvied, but had no otherwise but to give way. I would like to assure the people of Roysambu that \\nI am equal to the task and to the responsibilities that they have bestowed on me.  \\n\\nMhe.

There are parts of Roysambu where if you are blindfolded,  dropped there and asked \\nto say where you are, you would say that you are probably in a constituency in upcountry. In a \\nplace  like  Kahawa  West,  there  are  no  roads.  Places  like  Kiwanja  and  KM  behind  Kenyatta \\nUniversity  (KU)  have  never  been  supplied  with  clean  water.  I  know  that  the  responsibility \\nwhich has been bestowed on me by the Roysambu people is not a walk in the park. But I am \\ndetermined to serve them and to ensure that I take Roysambu to the next level of development. \\nLike any other constituency, Roysambu has its challenges, ranging from infrastructure \\ndevelopment to insecurity. We have a great problem of insecurity in Zimmerman, but we are \\ncurrently talking with security agents and plans are under way to ensure that security in that \\narea is beefed up. \\n\\nTurning  to  today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Motion,  I  would  like  to  support  it.  Personally,  I  have  a  very  bad \\nexperience with hunger. I do not know whether there is anybody in this House who has spent \\na night without taking supper, not because you do not have the appetite, but because you have \\nnothing to eat. What happens? Imagine waking up in the morning and there is no breakfast; \\nlunch time comes, there is nothing to eat; at night, there is no supper. It happened to me one \\ntime. After missing breakfast,  I decided to take a cup of hot water at night and thought that \\nwhen I go to bed, I would sleep until morning. When you go to bed when you are hungry, sleep \\ndoes not come. You will be awake the whole night till morning. Some parts of our country are \\nravaged  by  famine  and  hunger.  When  we  in  Nairobi  eat,  we  sometimes  feel  as  if  we  are \\ncommitting a crime considering that there are families and children without food. I support this \\nMotion. I fear that if nothing is done in this regard, many children will drop out of school. So, \\nthis Motion is urgent and something needs to be done before the situation gets out of hand. \\n\\nI thank you. \\n \\n\\n[The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Hon. \\n\\nDavid Ochieng') left the Chair] \\n\\n \\n\\n[The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Hon. \\n\\nOmboko Milemba) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Hon.

I \\n\\nwant to congratulate you and proceed with this debate. \\n\\nI thank Mheshimiwa Elsie for coming up with this Motion that has been on my mind. \\nTwo  days  ago,  I  requested  to  present  this  Motion  and  I  was  told  that  someone  was  already \\nworking on it. I want to congratulate her because this Motion is so timely. \\n\\nSome of us come from areas that are seriously affected by drought. We know what is \\nhappening on the ground. Many children have already dropped out of school. Some of them \\nhave already registered for exams. They are supposed to sit for the exams towards the end of \\nthe year just like any other students in this country. That is why the school feeding policy is \\nquite crucial at this particular time. \\n\\nFrom what Members have shared today, we have heard that most areas, including areas \\nsome of us would not imagine, are experiencing the same challenges. This confirms that there \\nis need for us to have a school feeding programme. As we all know, some families may only \\nafford one meal while others may not even afford a meal today. If the Government was good \\nat planning, we would not be in this situation today. But we are here year-in, year-out, crying \\nand debating about drought and coming up with policies and suggesting good ideas that have \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

If we invest in this school feeding programme, we know very well that \\nthe number of the students that are dropping out of school will reduce, and that the health of \\nour children will improve. We also know that concentration levels will go high. As a result, \\nperformance in end of year exams that are coming will also give us some good results. \\n\\nI  support  the  Motion.  I  donate  the  remaining  time  to  others.  Thank  you,  Hon. \\n\\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Hon. Omboko Milemba): Thank you for donating \\n\\nAs of today, we are wondering what will happen to students who have no food at home \\nand cannot go to school because schools do not provide. I congratulate our President for giving \\nin  to  those  demands  and  increasing  funds  towards  the  school  feeding  programme.  It  is  my \\nprayer that the implementation will happen soon. \\nI want to donate a bit of my time to others. \\nAs I finish, proper policies should be put in place so that we are guided to not always \\nrush into crisis and be reactive. Right now, we are just reacting to the problems that we are \\nfacing.  \\n \\nI suggest proper monitoring and evaluation to take place after every three years so that \\nthis  House  is  guided  by  the  facts  that  will  be  found.  I  call  upon  the  national  and  county \\ngovernments to give this serious matter proper attention and focus on areas that are seriously \\naffected by drought - that is the northern parts of Kenya and other areas. That is so that we can \\nat least save lives, elevate the lives of our children and take them back to school to sit for their \\nexams. Some supplements may be provided in schools. We call upon the donors who can give \\nthe supplements to school going children to make them energetic enough to do so.  \\n \\nTemporary Deputy Speaker.  \\n \\nsome time to the rest. Let us have the Honorable Member for Kajiado West, Hon. George.  \\n \\nHon. George Sunkuiya (Kajiado West, UDA): Thank you, Hon.

It is through hard work, commitment and resilience. I take \\nthis opportunity to thank the people of Kajiado West Constituency, whom I treasure, as well as \\nmy think tank, my wife, the bishops in my constituency, and the pastors and prayer men and \\nwomen  who  have  been  working  very  hard  and  tirelessly  to  deliver  my  victory.  I  also \\ncongratulate you for your election as a member of the Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Panel.   \\n \\nI thank the five wards from my constituency: the people of Mosiro Ward, Magadi Ward, \\nIloodokilani Ward, Ewaso Kedong\\xe2\\x80\\x99, and more specifically the people of Keekonyokie Ward. \\nThey have elected me as a councillor two terms, one term  as Member of County Assembly \\n(MCA) and these other two terms as a Member of Parliament. With the help of God, I promise \\nto serve them diligently and give my best.  \\n \\nI congratulate His Excellency Dr. William Ruto for being elected as President and for \\nhis support of being a mentor to many out here. I also congratulate his Excellency the Deputy \\nPresident, Rigathi Gachagua, upon his election.  \\n \\nAs an upholder of the bottom-up system, I work as a businessman by selling livestock \\nwithout capital. I urge Kenyans to make ends meet. There is hope and light at the end of the \\ntunnel. I congratulate my Hon. Speaker, Moses Wetang'ula, and the Hon. Deputy Speaker, who \\nare residents of Kajiado West Constituency. The only thing missing there is that they are not \\nregistered as voters in that constituency. I take this time to congratulate the Hon. Speaker, aka \\nPapa wa Roma, who delivered 71 per cent of Kenyans in Bungoma to Kenya Kwanza.  \\n \\nThe speech of His Excellency Dr. William Ruto concerning the allocation of Kshs50 \\nbillion  to  the  Hustler  Fund  will  be  a  tremendous  benefit  to  farmers,  and  small  and  medium \\nenterprises. The people will be able to access affordable credit and expand their businesses as \\nwell  as  leverage  on  technology  in  the  management  and  disbursement  of  the  Hustler  Fund. \\nPresident William Ruto has the heart of transforming this country to  another milestone.

If something is possible, he will act - not \\nlike the Kshs6,000 for each family or the handshake government which is from the other side \\nof the story. Those things almost brought this country to a place where we were not expecting. \\nIn my constituency, the issue of water and food security is a big problem. The feeding \\nprogramme, which has been tabled here, needs very urgent attention by this honourable House. \\nIt is a very demanding and pertinent matter that needs a quick response.  \\n\\nSuccessful leaders  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because we are leaders  who Kenyans  are looking up to  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  build \\neach  other.  We  need  to  think  about  this  country,  motivate,  inspire  and  push  each  other. \\nUnsuccessful leaders, on the other hand, just complain,  hate and claim.  I want  to  praise the \\nPresident\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech for being elaborate, articulate and precise. I also want to say that the issue \\nof development of the school feeding programme is affecting every Kenyan and our children. \\nMany  children  are  living  without  anything.  We  need  to  take  action  because  many  people \\ndepend on long and short rains. Therefore, we need to declare that the drought is a national \\ndisaster in this country. I would like to take this opportunity to support this Motion and urge \\nthat we take action.  \\n\\nI rest my case and donate some time to other Members. Thank you, Hon. Temporary \\n\\nDeputy Speaker \\n\\nThe  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker  (Hon.  Omboko  Milemba):  Very  well.  The  Hon. \\nMember  is  donating  when  he  has  actually  finished  his  time,  but  I  want  to  encourage  the \\nspeakers who may follow when given a chance, to summarise so that we donate more time. \\nNext is Member of Parliament for Narok South. Proceed.  \\n\\nHon.  Kitilai  ole  Ntuntu  (Narok  South,  Independent):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary \\nDeputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on this important Motion that is \\npertaining to the development of a school feeding policy by Hon. Muhanda. Before I go into \\nthat, I would like to salute and appreciate the people of Narok South for sending me to this \\nhonourable House through an independent ticket. It was not an easy task but a big fight. For \\nthe people of Narok South, I would like to say thank you very much.  \\n\\nHon. Temporary Speaker, going into the Motion, I rise to fully support this important \\nMotion  because  coming  up  with  a  clear  legal  framework  that  will  regulate  the  feeding \\nprogramme in our public schools will not only be about the improvement of nutrition intake \\nfor our children, but it will also be the surest way to sustain education of our young learners in \\nKenyan schools. As I speak in this honourable House, many children in Kenya including those \\nfrom Narok South where I represent in this House, are not in school now due to the ongoing \\ndrought as a result of failed rains. The prolonged dry spells and drought, in several parts of this \\ncountry have affected livestock like sheep and cattle in Narok South and Kenya in general, and \\nespecially in Arid and Semi-Arid Land (ASAL) areas. The current drought in Kenya has forced \\nmany pastoralists in Narok South to migrate to very far areas in search of pasture and water for \\ntheir livestock; thus interrupting learners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 educational calendar. The absence of our learners in \\nschool has not only affected their academic performance over the years, but has also made a \\nbig percentage to drop out of schools, especially the girl child. This is due to early pregnancy \\nand marriages.  \\n\\nAccording  to  international,  regional  and  national  focus,  there  is  a  high  likelihood  of \\nbelow average rainfall during the October to December short rains across northern and eastern \\nKenya. Due to this change of climatic conditions globally, we must be prepared for the future \\nof learners by  mitigating the effect  of drought.  If there was  a proper  feeding programme to \\nsustain those kids in school, they would remain in school and learn uninterrupted at all times.  \\nHon. Temporary Speaker, areas of Naroosura, Enkutoto, Loita and Maji Moto are the \\nmain affected areas by drought in Narok South, the constituency which I represent. It is high \\ntime Parliament came up with a school feeding programme that is supported by a clear policy \\nand budgetary framework that is fully anchored in the law. This will go very far in supporting \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Arid and semi-arid areas are part of Kenya, that \\nis,  Northern  Kenya  and  Eastern  Kenya.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  beg  to  support  this  very \\nimportant Motion.  \\n\\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Omboko Milemba): Very well. Thank  you \\n\\nfor saving some time. Next is the Hon. Member for Kipkelion East.  \\n\\nHon. Joseph Cherorot (Kipkelion East, UDA): Thank you so much Hon. Temporary \\nSpeaker. My name is Joseph Cherorot from Kipkelion East. First of all, I would like to take \\nthis time to congratulate His Excellency the President of the Republic of Kenya and his Deputy \\nfor  being  elected  as  leaders  of  this  country.  Secondly,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  Hon. \\nSpeaker, Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula and also Hon. Deputy Speaker, Gladys Shollei, on their election. Thank \\nyou also Hon. Temporary Deputy Speaker for standing in as one of the speakers. I would like \\nto thank the people of Kipkelion East for electing me into this august House. For this reason, I \\nowe them a lot because of what they did to me. It has been a long journey for me as this was \\nmy fourth time to contest and I thank God because it has come to this time that I am actually \\nthe Member of Parliament for Kipkelion East.  \\n\\nI also want to say this about Kipkelion East. This is an area that has been marginalised \\nfor a long time and we have a lot of projects which have stalled. We have roads which have \\nexisted  since  time  immemorial  and  they  have  not  been  tarmacked.  We  have  Furaha-Ilotii-\\nOltopil  road and also  the  Londiani-Makutano  road. Those roads have been there since time \\nimmemorial and they have not been tarmacked. We also have water problems in that area.  \\n\\nHon. Temporary Deputy Speaker, some key issues that we also have in this area and \\nwhich need to be tackled is electricity. The people of Kipkelion East have been looking forward \\nand yearning to have electricity because most homes have not been connected. I want to assure \\nthem that I am ready to work with them hand-in-hand and make sure that most of the homes \\nare connected under the Last Mile Programme.  \\n\\nThey should also get clean water.  Hon. Temporary Deputy Speaker, we  also have a \\nproposed referral hospital in  Londiani, which has taken 12  years without being constructed. \\nThat hospital is supposed to help the people of Londiani and the larger Kericho County. If you \\nsit along Muhoroni road, you will notice many ambulances going to Eldoret that are carrying \\nsick people from our area. I promise the people of Kipkelion that I am going to make sure that \\nthe referral hospital is built.   \\n\\nConcerning  the  issue  of  the  development  of  a  school  feeding  policy,  it  is  a  good \\nprogramme. I thank Hon. Elsie Muhanda for bringing this Motion.  This one has to be handled \\nin a proper way.  Logistics have to be put in place and make sure that the feeding programme \\nis going to be consistent.  By doing so means that we must have proper structures in place so \\nthat our children in school can benefit from this programme. We have to look for long term \\nsolutions so that we may not only do it just for a short while. Therefore, it requires a lot of \\nengagement, especially from the Ministries of Agriculture and Health. Some of the things that \\nmust be considered is the health of our children. That means that hygiene should be practised \\nand make sure that the children get the food at the right time. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Temporary Deputy Speaker. I wish to donate my remaining time to \\n\\nthe rest of the Members. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n[The Temporary Speaker (Hon. \\nOmboko Milemba) left the Chair] \\n\\n[The Temporary Speaker (Hon. \\nDavid Ochieng) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

David Ochieng'): Thank you so much. This \\n\\nchance goes to the Member for Turbo, Hon. Janet Sitienei. \\n\\nHon. (Ms.) Janet Sitienei (Turbo, UDA): Thank you Hon. Temporary Speaker. I was \\nalmost giving up. I wish to take this opportunity to thank you for giving me this chance to add \\nmy  voice  to  this  Motion.  I  congratulate  you  for  meriting  the  Chairperson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Panel  and \\ncongratulate the substantive Speaker, Hon. Moses Wetang'ula and the Deputy Speaker Hon. \\nGladys Boss.  I also want to take this opportunity to thank the people of Turbo.  I also thank \\nthe Almighty God for giving me another opportunity to come to this august House.  I thank my \\nfamily led by my husband. I also want to thank the people of Turbo for believing in me again. \\nI  thank  the  people  of  Ngenyilel,  Tapsagoi,  Kamagut,  Kiplombe,  Kapsaos  and  Huruma  for \\nbelieving in me once more.  I pledge to work very hard to ensure that service delivery is up to \\ndate.  \\n\\nI also want to thank the President of the Republic of Kenya because he is a voter in my \\nconstituency and he voted for me; including Her Excellency Rachel Ruto. I want to thank them \\nso much. It is humbling to be voted in by the President.   \\n\\nI want to add my voice to the Motion and thank Hon. Elsie Muhanda for bringing it. It \\nis on the development of a school feeding policy.  It is, indeed, a very important Motion that \\nbrings in the issue of school feeding programme in our schools.  It is very important because \\nthis is the only way to mitigate on hunger and malnutrition in the basic and secondary schools.  \\nGiven  that  4.1  million  people  are  hungry  in  this  Nation,  by  introducing  the  school  feeding \\nprogramme, it is going to go a long way in ensuring that there is increase in enrolment, there \\nwill be improved results in our schools and struggling for 100 per cent transition will be a thing \\nof the past.  It has been so difficult to ensure that schools have 100 per cent transition when \\nfamilies have no food to give to their children.  When some families go hungry in a day, some \\nhave no meal or three meals in a day. So, this will go a long way in ensuring that there is 100 \\nper cent  transition.    It  is  also  going to  help  improve the nutrition  of our children. When we \\nimprove  on  the  nutrition  of  our  children,  we  are  also  improving  on  their  IQ  and  hence,  the \\nresults will even be better. \\n\\nThose of us who were in school in the 1970s never had the school feeding programme. \\nBut for those who joined in the 1980s, I still remember there was something called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSUPRO\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\nI am sure many of you do not know that. It was a very nice meal that was given to the primary \\nschool children and it enhanced the nutritional value of the children. In the 1990s, came the \\nNyayo  Milk  that  also  enhanced  the  nutrition  of  the  children  then.    We  do  not  know  what \\nhappened. We urge the Government to go back to the shelves.  I believe the policies are still \\nthere and they can dust them and improve on them so that we do not spend more money forming \\ntaskforces to look into the school feeding program.  Those policies are there and we can only \\ndust them, look at them and implement them. \\n\\nI thank God for the new Government, the Kenya Kwanza Government  because they \\nhave  a  plan.  It  is  going  to  be  implemented.  We  saw  our  President  actually  eating  with  the \\nchildren in one of the schools in Nairobi.  That means he wants to support the School Feeding \\nProgramme.  So, I assure Hon. Elsie that this will be done.  For that to happen, we need to do \\na few things. For it to be cost-effective, the Government has to work smart to reduce on the \\neffect of drought and to ensure the country is food secure.  \\n\\nI support this Motion that the school feeding programme be back in our schools. Thank \\n\\nyou for giving me this opportunity. \\n\\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. David Ochieng): Thank you very much Member for \\nTurbo.  I just want to request the Members that we could all speak if we mind that we are many \\nand we make our speeches brief.  The next speaker is the Member for Ijara. \\n\\nHon. Abdi Ali Abdi (Ijara, NAP-K): Thank you very much, Hon. Temporary Speaker, \\nfor  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  speak  in  the  13th  Parliament  as  a  new  comer.  For  record \\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The  National  Agenda  Party  of  Kenya  is  a  coalition  partner  in  the \\nKenya Kwanza Alliance. It is the single majority party in the Garissa County Assembly with \\neight Members of the County Assembly (MCAs).  \\n\\nIt  is  with  humility  and  excitement  that  I  make  my  maiden  speech  representing  Ijara \\nConstituency, the jewel of Northern Kenya. I also take this opportunity to thank the Almighty \\nGod  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  be  elected  to  this  august  House  as  the  Member  of \\nParliament for Ijara. It is not easy. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the great \\npeople of Ijara Constituency, my family, the women, friends, youths and the elderly who stood \\nwith me during my campaigns, who showed great confidence in me and voted me in as their \\nMember of Parliament. I am humbled by their firm faith and belief in my ability to represent \\nthem in the august House. I am honoured to serve them as their Member of Parliament. I hope \\nI can repay the faith they have placed in me.  \\n\\nI  also  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  our  President  and  his  Deputy  for  their \\nelection. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the Speaker of the National Assembly and \\nthe Deputy Speaker, in absentia, for their election. I also take this opportunity to congratulate \\nyou, Hon. Temporary Speaker, for being appointed to the Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Panel of the Assembly.   \\nAs you are aware, Ijara is located 100 kilometres away from Lamu and 180 kilometres \\naway from Garissa. It is the home of the Hirola. It is the only place where you will  find the \\nHirola in Kenya. Ijara has many problems. I may not have time to explain all of them in detail, \\nbut I will focus on a few key issues. \\n\\nThere is the issue of roads. We do not have any road network connection in Ijara. The \\nsame  applies  to  electricity.  The  only  place  where  there  is  electricity  is  at  the  constituency \\nheadquarters in Masalani. Other parts of Ijara have no electricity.  \\n\\nThe other issue is insecurity, as we border Somalia. One of my key agenda is to make \\nsure that I deliver, inshallah, and with the help of God, address all these issues. I look forward \\nto opening a border point in Hulugho, which will ease movement of goods and services and, at \\nthe same time, improve on the insecurity that we have there.  \\n\\nThe other issue that I want to push is the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport \\n(LAPSSET) project. LAPSSET is a flagship project. It is a mega project that will open up the \\nmarket  for  Ijara  and  the  entire  Northern  Kenya.  I  request  the  Executive  to  make  sure  that \\nLAPSSET  is  implemented  to  the  letter.  That  is  because  it  will  open  up  opportunities  both \\ninternally and externally.  \\n\\nThe other thing that I am looking forward to is enhancing food security. Ijara is fertile \\n\\nand fit for seasonal farming with the right seedlings and fertilisers.   \\n\\nThe  other  thing  that  I  look  forward  to  addressing  is  education.  The  removal  of \\naffirmative  action  by  the  previous  Government  led  to  poor  performance  of  education  in \\nNorthern Kenya. I appeal to the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to reintroduce affirmative \\naction, which will increase the student-teacher ratio.    \\n\\nOur  country  is  facing  a  historical  drought  with  some  regions,  including  my  own \\nconstituency, not receiving any signs of rainfall for the last four seasons. The drought situation \\nin  my  constituency  is  currently  at  an  alarming  stage  and  is  the  worst  that  has  ever  been \\nwitnessed. The prolonged drought has affected livestock and deteriorated the food situation. \\nThe situation is so bad that last month, a very sad incident happened in my constituency after \\nfour hyenas attacked six of my constituents in Sagar and Warsame, in a case of human-wildlife \\nconflict. Currently, buffalos are dying in mud at a dry water pan in my constituency in a village \\ncalled Karmatha. Due to this failure of rainfall, the condition of our livestock is poor. Water \\npans have dried up. Livestock rely on boreholes, which frequently break down. Livestock do \\nnot fetch any prices and there is no milk available. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I thank His Excellency \\nthe  President  and  the  national  Government  for  the  few  small  interventions  of  marshalling \\nresources  and  releasing  enough  consignments  to  3.5  million  people.  On  behalf  of  my \\nconstituency, I still appeal for more support in upscaling this relief food to more pastoralists to \\nenhance the emergence of cash transfers, animal feeds and provision of water for both humans \\nand livestock.  \\n\\nFellow Hon. Members, while distribution of relief food is important at this moment in \\ntime, it is our mandate, as the 13th Parliament, to engage relevant stakeholders in finding, not \\nonly  urgent  measures  to  protect  our  people  and  their  livelihoods  from  the  effects  of  the \\ndevastating  drought  and  climate  change,  but  also  to  ensure  that  we  provide  sustainable  and \\ncomprehensive solutions of land restoration, which address many of the underlying factors of \\ndegrading water cycles and loss of soil fertility.    \\n\\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. David Ochieng\\xe2\\x80\\x99): Thank you so much. This chance \\n\\ngoes to the Member for Mathioya.  \\n\\nHon.  Edwin  Gichuki  (Mathioya,  UDA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker,  for \\n\\ngiving me this opportunity to address the House for a second time. \\n\\nFirst, I support the Motion on the school-feeding policy. The Motion was due. I do not \\nwant to repeat much that has been said by my colleagues, but I would just like to say one thing. \\nEvidence  has  shown  that  because  children  in  boarding  schools  get  all  meals,  including \\nbreakfast, lunch and supper, they perform better than those in day schools, especially those in \\nunder-privileged day schools that do not have access to some of that food.  \\n\\nI would like to maybe suggest one thing. I know the school-feeding programme is a \\nshort-term intervention measure. The key to ensuring that our children survive in schools is to \\nbuild capacity for schools to also produce food. There is one Member who has said that schools \\nhave very big parcels of land, which is true. I remember in the 1990s and 2000s when we were \\nin school, we used to produce our own food. We had cattle and we used to milk the cows for \\nschool milk, tea and other uses.  We used to plant maize, beans and potatoes and the school \\nwas self-sufficient in terms of food.  Looking at the history of this school feeding program, we \\nknow that in the 1980s there was the Maziwa ya Nyayo programme which some of us were also \\nprivileged to be part of in our primary schools.  I think that is why we used to perform better \\ncompared to some of the learners now because as we know milk provides a lot of the nutrients.  \\nThe program was cancelled by the late President Kibaki\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Government because of it cost.  \\n\\n In March 2022, there was an Education  Bill  in  this  House, which was proposing to \\nintroduce free milk in pre- primary school and public primary schools. This House rejected the \\nBill because of the cost.  I looked at the statistics and it was costing Kshs1 billion a week and \\nKshs36 billion annually because out of 53 weeks, I think the school programme is 36 weeks.  \\nTherefore, We need to look at the budget implication so that we do not go through all the stages \\nand  then  realise  there  is  no  budget  to  support  the  program.    With  that,  I  would  also  like  to \\ndonate my time. I fully support this Motion. \\n\\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Hon. David Ochieng): Thank you so much. I wish \\nall of us could be like the Member for Mathioya.  The next chance goes to the Member for \\nKiambu, Hon. John Waithaka. \\n\\nHon.  John  Waithaka  (Kiambu,  UDA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker  for \\ngiving me this opportunity to make my maiden speech in this honourable House.  I do not take \\nthis  opportunity  for  granted  and  I  will  always  be  thankful.    My  name  is  Mr  John  Machua \\nWaithaka also known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMachua Sure Bet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, the Member of Parliament for Kiambu Town. \\nLet me first congratulate the Hon. Speaker, Hon. Moses Wetang'ula and the Deputy Speaker, \\nHon. Boss Shollei, for their election as Speaker and Deputy Speaker respectively, in the 13th \\nParliament.  I sincerely wish them all the best in the task of guiding the proceedings of this \\nHouse. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  let  me  take  this  early \\nopportunity to thank the entire leadership of my Party, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) \\nincluding  His  Excellency  President  Dr.  William  Samoei  Ruto  and  his  Deputy,  Rigathi \\nGachagua for being elected as the 5th President and the Deputy President of the Republic of \\nKenya, respectively.  May the Almighty God give them wisdom in this journey to transform \\nthe country.   \\n\\nIt  is  indeed  a  great  moment  that  I  stand  before  this  House  to  join  my  fellow \\nParliamentarians in  thanking the Almighty God for the favour he has bestowed on us.  It  is \\ndifficult to put into words the enormous pride I feel standing in this Chamber as a representative \\nof the great people of Kiambu. They presented me with this chance to be their voice of reason.  \\nI  take  pride  in  being  elected  as  the  Member  of  Parliament  but  I  feel  humbled  by  the \\nresponsibility it carries.  It is my hope that while in this House,  I will promote constructive \\nsolutions based on equity and social justice for the problems that challenge us today. \\n\\n  Being a new Member of this House is a milestone for me; there is much to say. As my \\nfellow Parliamentarians are aware, the road to Parliament is not a journey that one makes alone.  \\nIt is an effort of family, friends, volunteers, political parties and the voting public.  All have \\ncontributed to making my campaign a success and I sincerely wish to thank them for helping \\nme achieve this position.  I do not take this lightly. I pledge my loyalty to the people of Kiambu \\nand earnestly thank them for putting their trust in me.  Let me assure them that I will be their \\nchampion and will whole heartedly defend their rights and prosperity in this House.   \\n\\nThe promotion of good governance requires a Parliament that can effectively perform \\nthe  functions  of  representation,  oversight  and  law-making.  Our  ability  to  control  public \\nexpenditure  will  be  a  good  service  to  our  people.    The  Kenyan  people  are  looking  up  to \\nParliament and Government for solutions to problems that confront them on a daily basis.  Our \\npeople expect us to help fix the economy, provide jobs for the unemployed and improve access \\nand quality education, healthcare and generally give them hope.   \\n\\nAs to the Presidential Speech, Hon. Temporary Deputy Speaker, let me congratulate \\nour President Dr William Samoei Ruto for his promise to run an administration that is open \\nand transparent.  On my part, I promise His Excellency that I will reciprocate with my oversight \\nmandate  to  make  sure  the  public  gets  value  for  funds  invested  in  various  programmes  and \\npolicies.   \\n\\nDuring  our  campaigns,  the  President  promised  to  create  a  fund  to  assist  Small  and \\nMedium Enterprises (SMEs) to carry out their businesses.  I give the President a thumbs up for \\npromising to allocate Kshs 50 billion every year to the Hustler Fund to enable them expand \\ntheir businesses.  Indeed, the President did not disappoint in his Speech when he said that he \\nwill  make  sure  that  the  hustler  economy  flourishes  and  forms  the  foundation  of  broader \\neconomic transformation.   \\n\\nConcerning  electricity,  we  are  proud  of  the  President  for  promising  to  facilitate  the \\ndevelopment of effective and innovative modalities to provide better-off grid systems including \\nenabling customers to form small co-operatives for that purpose.  On health, the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nmove to have a universal healthcare reality and liberate Kenyans and their families from the \\nthreat of losing property has also come at the right time.  Every Kenyan should have access to \\ngood healthcare.  Hon. Speaker, the challenges facing Kiambu hospitals are insurmountable \\nand I would like to ask the relevant ministry in collaboration with the county government to \\nintervene and solve the many problems that are facing Level 5 hospitals. \\n\\nJust like other parts of Kenya, Kiambu Constituency has insecurity challenges. We have \\na crime hotspot in my constituency that requires security in line with the Presidential Directive \\nand Speech at the United Nations.  \\n\\nAdditionally,  children,  parents  and  teachers  in  my  constituency  are  in  dire  need  of \\nquality  education.    Kiambu  has  been  affected  by  the  prevailing  drought  which  has  affected \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I would, therefore, request the Government to consider food rations for \\npoor deserving households. While echoing the Presidents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Address, he emphasized that Kenya \\nshould become  a producer country  because, since time immemorial, the  country  has been  a \\nconsumer nation.  However, with Parliament, the fortunes of our country under his Excellency \\nare set to change and move Kenya to a greater growth. \\n\\nHon.  Speaker,  the  Kiambu-Nairobi  Road  was  earmarked  a  long  time  to  be  a  dual \\ncarriageway  by  the  12th  Parliament.    However,  even  after  public  participation  and  residents \\npaving way for the construction, the construction of the road is yet to start.  We would like the \\nGovernment to pay attention and complete the infrastructure projects.  The traffic congestion \\non the said road is too much and active. Productive Kenyans spend more than 2 hours to cover \\na distance of seven kilometres, thus wasting a lot of manpower, increased fuel consumption \\nand  pollution.    I  would  like  to  also  mention  the  roads  connecting  Kiambu  Road  through \\nThindigwa to Windsor and the road connecting Kamiti through Kiamumbi to Maziwa that need \\nto be done. \\n\\n The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Hon. David Ochieng): Thank you so much, Hon. \\nMember for Kiambu.  I still want to request those who will speak next to take, at least, three \\nminutes each without reading so that we can get time for about five Members to speak.  The \\nnext chance goes to the Member for Nandi Hills, Hon. Benard Kitur.  \\n\\nHon. Bernard Kitur (Nandi Hills, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker for \\ngiving me the chance to contribute to the Motion on the development of a school feeding policy \\nwhich has been sponsored by Hon. Elsie Muhanda. \\n\\nFor the record, this is my maiden speech. This is the first time that I am speaking on the \\nFloor of this House. I am Hon. Bernard Kitur, Member for Nandi Hills. I want to thank the \\nAlmighty God and, more sincerely, the people of Nandi Hills Constituency for electing and \\ngiving  me  the  chance  to  be  their  representative  in  this  august  House  in  the  hotly  contested \\nparliamentary elections. I want to thank the people of Kapchorua, Chepkunyuk, Ollessos and \\nNandi Hills Wards. They did an amazing work by giving me that chance. Definitely, I want to \\nassure them that under my representation, they will have their full share of the national cake.  \\nI  wish  to  also  congratulate  His  Excellency  the  President,  William  Samoei  Ruto,  for \\nbeing  elected  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  (CEO)  of  this  nation.  In  just  a  few  days,  he  has \\ndemonstrated  great  boldness  and  brilliance  in  articulating  macro  solutions  to  the  challenges \\nthat we, as a country, are facing. Despite the fact that Nandi County has never missed to have \\na Member of the Cabinet in the history of this country, I want to thank the President for recently \\nappointing  the  Chief  of  Staff  and  Head  of  Public  Service  from  my  constituency  in  Nandi \\nCounty - Commissioner Felix Kosgei  - who is a very brilliant career professional. We truly \\nappreciate him for that. \\n\\nMy fellow Members, I want to first congratulate all of us on being elected. Secondly, \\nthe seniors or ranking members should not be harsh to some of us. We are speaking for the first \\ntime in this House. We are all indebted to you for mentoring us. Please be kind to us. \\n\\nI  want  to  let the people  of Nandi  Hills Constituency  know briefly some  of the  great \\nchallenges we face. For instance, there is a tarmac road from Emaki to Nandi Hills that is in \\ndeplorable  condition,  despite  the  fact  that  it  cuts  through  the  tea  farm  lands  that  earn  this \\ncountry billions of shillings. It is an eyesore. Being in leadership and Government, I want to \\nassure them that constructing that road is one of the things that I will do to help them.  \\n\\nEqually,  when  the  President  made  a  Speech  here  recently,  he  mentioned  about  the \\ninvestment  in  the  water  sector  where  he  would  raise  Kshs5  billion  through  Public-Private \\nPartnerships (PPP). I want to assure the people of Nandi Hills that I will try as much as possible \\nto see the construction of Keben Dam. That has been a big prayer for the people. When we \\nhave that dam, the entire Nandi County as well as Nandi Hills Constituency will have sufficient \\nwater for irrigation. That rich region will change completely. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

As the \\nPresident made his Speech, the matter of public debt recurred. I want to talk briefly about the \\nhistory of the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement. The public debt of Kenya was Kshs1.9 trillion in 2013. It \\nstands at Kshs8.6 trillion now. This is something that affects all of us. It affects the people of \\nNandi Hills as well. This is a rise of about 353 per cent. When you also look at the borrowing \\nhistory, we had borrowed Kshs261 billion in 2013. It currently stands at Kshs866 billion. That \\nmeans  that  the  debt  interest  has  risen  from  Kshs121  billion  to  Kshs578  billion.  This  is  the \\nlargest expenditure item in our Budget which eclipses even our development spending. I want \\nto also put into record that, indeed, this affects all of us, as a country. It affects the people of \\nNandi Hills, all of us and the cost of doing business in Kenya. \\n\\nThe public debt  rose in  2013 from  42 per cent  to  50 per  cent.  This  has  exposed our \\ncountry to a lot of foreign exchange risks. For instance, I understand that between June 2021 \\nand  June  2022,  our  external  debt  rose  by  Kshs290  billion  without  borrowing  even  a  single \\nshilling from abroad. This is because every time there is a depreciation of the shilling by Kshs1, \\nwe  lose  Kshs40  billion.  For  that  reason  and  for  the  sake  of  the  economy  of  this  country,  I \\nsupport the President when he said that we cut down our recurrent expenditure in three years, \\nso that we may have an expenditure surplus. As Parliament, we should speed up to revise the \\ncurrent Budget to ensure that there is no borrowed money that ends up in recurrent expenditure. \\nI am just saying this because it is something that affects us, as a country. \\n\\nSecondly, Hon. Temporary Speaker, I want to touch and give my views on the Hustler \\nFund because most of the people in Nandi Hills are hustlers. This is a matter that they are very \\nkeen to listen to. It is a dream that we have harboured. I support the President when he said that \\nhe would implement it in the best way using technology. This is highly welcome, so that it does \\nnot go the way of the Youth Enterprise Development Fund where almost 60 per cent of the \\nfunds are in default. I also propose to have a Business Hustler Fund within the Hustler Fund \\nwhich  will  be  strictly  based  on  merit.  Till  or  pay  bill  numbers  will  be  used  to  look  at  the \\ntransaction  history  of  the  businesses.  They  will  work  together  with  the  telecommunication \\ncompanies. That will bring money that can circulate. So, I support the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s move. \\n\\nLastly, I want to also thank the President on matters of Credit Reference Bureau (CRB). \\nHe has helped about 4 million Kenyans to be removed from CRB. It is a very retrogressive, \\nrepressive, punitive and insensitive financial.... \\n\\nThe  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker  (Hon.  David  Ochieng\\xe2\\x80\\x99):  Thank  you  very  much, \\nMember for Nandi Hills. I will give this chance to Hon. Julius Rutto who will be last to speak \\non  this  particular  Motion.  I  am  so  sorry  to  the  other  Members.  This  is  because  of  the  time \\nconstraints and pressure in this particular Motion. \\n\\nHon. Julius Rutto (Kesses, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. First of all, \\nallow  me  to  congratulate  you  on  being  among  the  few  selected  Members  to  sit  in  the \\nChairperson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s panel.  \\n\\nI want to support the Motion on the development of a school feeding policy. I want to \\npoint out my support to Article 10 of the Constitution. This issue that we are discussing today \\nought to have been taken care of if, at all, we had implemented the spirit of the Constitution. \\nArticle 10 (2) of the Constitution says that the national values and principles of governance \\ninclude\\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\n \\ndemocracy and participation of the people;  \\n \\nnon-discrimination and protection of the marginalised; \\nWe should implement the Constitution as it is. I want to talk about where I come from. \\n \\nI am a product of the Nyayo era. When there was a Nyayo Day, it would be in school. What am \\n\\n(a)  patriotism,  national  unity,  sharing  and  devolution  of  power,  the  rule  of  law, \\n\\n(b) human dignity, equity, social justice, inclusiveness, equality, human rights,  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The constant experience of absenteeism that we see in our areas is contributed \\nmajorly by the lack of food and poor households\\xe2\\x80\\x99 earnings.  \\n\\nI  come  from  Eldoret.  I  am  a  Member  of  Parliament  for  Sekunanga  and  Racecourse \\nSlums. Racecourse Primary School has a population of more than 10,000 pupils. However, in \\nany given day, more than 200 pupils are always absent. Where do they go? They beg in the \\nstreets looking for food to provide for their households. We need to address these challenges \\nonce and for all. It is high time that both levels of Government, devolved and national, allocated \\nmore resources into it and plan around it. This is the composite approach that we need to look \\ninto.  \\n\\nI know that most of the county governments are busy making their county integrated \\ndevelopment plans. The national Government is also focusing on the integrated development \\nplans. It is high time we have a serious discussion on this. In the same spirit, the President tells \\nus to focus on our productivity vis-a-vis our consumption. When we put more energy in our \\nproduction area and then we support our school-going children, we will support agriculture and \\nthe farmers. At the end of the day, we will use one stone to kill two birds: build up our economy \\nand sort out food security.  \\n\\nWhen you look at the budget structure of our country, matters of national interest fail \\nto  touch  on  food  security.  It  focuses  on  weapons,  which  is  national  security.  We  should \\nconsider  threat  to  food  security  as  a  security  matter  in  the  same  way  we  look  at  national \\nsecurity. We should allocate resources where it deserves. When we have enough production, \\nespecially local production with the cheap labour and cost of production, the cost of providing \\nfood to children will come down. If we have deficiency of nutrients, it then means we will have \\nsickness.  \\n\\nFinally, I would have wished to respond to my brother, the Member for Embakasi West. \\nHe said that they are looking upon this Government to bring down the cost of living. It is hardly \\na month since the new Administration took over. Hon. Raila Odinga, with due respect, kindly, \\nallow the current Administration to sort out the problems that they inherited from the previous \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chandshake\\xe2\\x80\\x9d regime where the cost of living rose up because of poor prioritisation and decision \\nmaking.  Allow  this  Administration  to  cure  the  problems  and  focus  on  how  to  address \\npermanent  perennial  challenges  by  sorting  out  the  real  problem;  and  not  massaging,  but \\nsurgering them out, to ensure we  once and for all cure  the living cost.  \\n\\nThank you so much for allowing me this opportunity. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. David Ochieng\\xe2\\x80\\x99): Thank you so much, Member for \\n\\nKesses.  \\n\\nThat marks the end of debate on this Motion; and like I said, I apologise to Members \\nwho were not able to speak. Next time, they will have an opportunity to do so. The Mover of \\nthis Motion would be asked to reply to it next time.  \\n\\nHon.

Your microphone is working now.  \\n \\n \\nHon.  Ndindi  Nyoro  (Kiharu,  UDA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  for  this \\nopportunity.  This  House  is  very  anxious,  and  our  country  is  paralysed  in  so  far  as  the \\ndetermination of the majority and minority sides in this House is concerned. The Speaker had \\nindicated that this House was expecting a Communication from the Chair so that we determine \\nthe  majority  and  minority  sides.  This  will  allow  us  to  continue  with  the  very  business  that \\nbrought us to this House.  \\n\\nI seek your guidance because the country cannot continue to wait in paralysis and this \\n\\nI seek your communication. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, hold your horses. We still have until 8.00 p.m. \\n\\nHouse cannot continue to wait in anxiety.  \\n \\n \\nThe session is not yet over.  \\n \\n\\n \\nNow, I will call upon the Member for\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\nProceed now that you are on your feet. \\nHon. Junet Mohamed (Suna East, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. We stand \\nguided as per your communication. As you are aware, this is a House of record and procedure. \\nThe last communication that we heard from the substantive Speaker was that he would deliver \\na ruling on the issue of the majority and minority sides on Thursday, 6th October 2022 at 2.30 \\np.m.  It  is  in  the  Hansard.  The  Hansard  will  bear  me  witness  that  the  Speaker  pronounced \\nhimself on the Floor of the House that he would deliver his ruling at 2.30 p.m. It is now 2.44 \\np.m. We are late by 14 minutes. Maybe the ruling is not ready, or the law has taken its course \\nand wisdom has befallen the leadership of the House and they have realised that the Azimio la \\nUmoja-One Kenya Alliance is the majority side, so that we move forward. We need to move \\nthe country forward as my colleague, the Kiharu Member of Parliament (MP), alluded to. We \\nshould not keep the country paralysed nor Parliament in anxiety.   \\n\\nThe rule of law is very  clear, as lawyers say. The law is very clear. There are many \\nlawyers in this House, some of who are Senior Counsels. I think Hon. Murugara is here. The \\nlawyers are here. The law is very clear. So, can we authoritatively say that the decision has \\nbeen made in silence that the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance is the majority party in the \\nHouse, we move forward and conduct business as it is known in Parliament?   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Hon.  Member,  you  are  out  of  order.  You  have  no  power  or \\nauthority to make a ruling on that point. The Hon. Speaker clearly communicated that he would \\ngive his ruling during this session that starts at 2.30 p.m. and ends at 8.00 p.m. Until we get to \\n8.00 p.m., we still have time. \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n  \\nOrder, Hon. Members! We will proceed with the debate. I have put that issue to a close. \\n\\nWe will now proceed to continue with the debate. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It is your turn.  \\nHon. Phelix Odiwour (Lang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ata, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. First of \\nall, let me take this opportunity to congratulate you for having been elected the Deputy Speaker \\nof this House. I also take this opportunity to thank the people of Lang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ata for giving me the \\nchance to represent them in this august House. I thank Team Jalas that put up a very big battle. \\nThe battle for Lang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ata was not an easy one. I take this opportunity to also thank my party, the \\nOrange  Democratic  Movement  (ODM),  and  my  party  leader,  Raila  Amolo  Odinga,  who \\nsupported me all the way to the end. I thank the teams from Mugumoini, Highrise, South C, \\nNairobi West, and Karen Wards. Most of the Members here are my constituents. Thank you \\nfor  your support. I take this opportunity to, again, thank my family that was with me in the \\nbattle.  \\n\\nI picked one thing in the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech that is very key for my constituency, which \\nis affordable housing. I am happy that the President is coming to  Lang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ata this week for the \\nlaunch of 4,500 houses in Zone B of Nyayo Highrise. I take this opportunity to tell the people \\nof Lang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ata to be ready. This project has taken long but it will finally come to fruition.  \\n\\nSecondly, I would like to talk about the Hustler Fund. I would like the fund to be given \\nto the Members of this House to care and be in charge of it. We campaigned with the hustlers \\nand we know them better than anyone else. We were with them.  \\n\\nI also want to talk about the savings that the President talked about. If the Hustler Fund \\nis coming, let the savings also be directed to the hustlers themselves so that they receive and \\nsave them on their own. Let them not be given to anybody else.  \\n\\nFor Lang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ata, I want to talk about stalled projects. We have a case in South C Market \\nwhere the land has already been allocated. They are just waiting for a few confirmations and \\napprovals  from  the county  government.  I request  the county  government  to  expedite this  so \\nthat work in that market can begin in earnest. I also thank the team that has been pushing for \\nMugumoini Market to start operating. Chairman Alois, I know you are watching. You asked \\nme to push for this market. The lawyers who are here, help us push for this market so that the \\nsmall battles we have in court can come to an end. We want this over and done with.  \\n \\nI  take  this  opportunity  to  tell  the  people  of  Lang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ata  that  the  issue  of  water  will  be \\naddressed.  Anytime  one  mentions  Lang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ata  everybody  talks  about  water.  The  Northern \\nCorridor Grid is already being worked on. We hope the water issue will finally end during this \\nterm  and  my  regime  as  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  Lang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ata.  That  is  when  the  Northern \\nCorridor infrastructure is completed and we are gridded into it. \\n \\nruling that Azimio is the Majority in this House. That is when he comes here later.  \\n\\nFinally,  I ask the Hon. Speaker to, in his wisdom and wherever he is, make the best \\n\\nThank you so much, Hon. Deputy Speaker.  \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\n \\nI  donate  the  remainder  of  my  time  to  Hon.  Salasya.  He  had  requested  me  to  donate \\nsome two minutes to him. He had something he wanted to say. Hon. Salasya is here. Thank \\nyou. \\n \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  No.  You  are  out  of  order.  I  now  call  upon  the  Member  for \\n\\n \\nKigumo. \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Joseph Munyoro (Kigumo, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. My name \\n \\nis  Joseph  Kamau  Munyoro  from  Kigumo  Constituency.  I  take  this  opportunity  to,  first, \\ncongratulate  the  Hon.  Speaker,  Moses  Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula  and  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  on  your \\nelection  as  the  Deputy  Speaker.  I  also  congratulate  our  President,  His  Excellency  William \\nSamoei Ruto and the Deputy President, Rigathi Gachagua on their election. \\n\\nSecondly, I thank the people of Kigumo for giving me this opportunity to serve them \\nas  their  representative  in  this  13th  Parliament.  People  from  Kahumbu,  Muthithi,  Kigumo, \\nKinyona  and  Kangari  Wards,  I  thank  you.  I  promise  you  that  I  do  not  take  for  granted  the \\nelection we conducted and you giving me the votes overwhelmingly. I will endeavour to serve \\nyou. I assure you that I will keep all the promises I made. I also take this opportunity to thank \\nmy family, my dear wife and children for the support they gave me during the campaigns. I \\nthank  my  extended  family  too  and  my  brothers  and  sisters,  and  my  mother  in  Mareira,  for \\ngiving the support that was required during the campaigns, for me to get to this Parliament. I \\nassure them that our family name is in safe hands. \\nI would like to tell the people of Kigumo that we have projects that we are following \\n \\nup. We have Kangari Market that, we know, is halfway done. I assure them that we will be \\nlooking at it and making sure that it is completed. We are launching Muthithi Market. We will \\ndo ground breaking next week. I assure them that we will ensure that all the projects we have \\nin the constituency are completed during my term. I also assure them that we have spoken about \\nbursaries and the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF). I thank \\nthe President for mentioning it here and assuring us that we will have the kitty to enable us \\neducate our children. We know that many of them are at home and some of these children can \\nonly be helped by paying their school fees from the kitty. We assure them that we will do that \\nwithout favour, and it will get to the needy people. \\n \\nTo comment on the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, one of the things that really touched us as the \\npeople of Kigumo is on agriculture. We come from an agricultural constituency. We have tea \\nand coffee, and we do dairy farming and horticulture. Many of us are touched by farming. So, \\nthe issue of fertiliser subsidy has really helped. That is money directly put into people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pockets \\nthrough the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Order to have the cost of fertiliser reduced. I saw the President meeting \\nwith the Tea Board of Kenya yesterday. I request him that we also look at the market. As we \\nget the farmers, especially of tea, let us do away with the cartels that control the prices. Since \\nhe has decided that we should go with one brand that is Kenyan and stop having blends, I ask \\nhim to look at having a better market for our tea farmers so that we can put more money into \\ntheir pockets. \\n \\nI thank the President too for mentioning the Hustler Fund. We are waiting for the kitty \\nbecause our  young men and women are at home and most of them are jobless. They do not \\nhave  capital  to  start  and  run  their  businesses  to  enable  them  feed  their  children.  He  also \\nmentioned the issue of water. Water is one of our real problems, especially in the lower areas \\nof  our  constituency.  We  would  like  to  be  involved  as  much  as  possible  because  if  we  are \\nincreasing the water supply from 60 per cent to 80 per cent, the constituencies that suffer most \\nshould be at the frontline. The lower area of Kigumo, especially Kahumbu, parts of Muthithi \\nand areas of Kangare need support and water made available.  \\n \\nthat they can start their businesses even in the Jua Kali sector and run them for income. \\n\\nThe President mentioned electricity. We want to  connect our people  to  electricity so \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I will also mention the issue of interest rates, and especially the \\nFuliza issue. We know that many of our people have those loans on their phones. Some of them \\ncannot transact using M-Pesa due to these loans. The lowering of the interest rates is really a \\ngood thing for us. I hope they will be lowered even further because even the 50 per cent is still \\nhigh.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

We have the Mau Road that is being constructed \\nand we have had issues with it. This is because it traverses more than one constituency. It would \\nbe fair for the Cabinet Secretary to answer one Question instead of each Member of Parliament \\nasking a Question to the Cabinet Secretary on their own, and them having to prepare an Answer \\nfor each one of us. That should be supported. On any legal framework that will come into this \\nHouse for us to actualise, I assure the President of our support.  \\nI will finish by saying that, coming from an agricultural constituency, we will still need \\n \\nmore to be done for our agriculture. There is market for our Hass avocadoes. We need to be \\nassured  because  we  have  somewhat  of  a  cartel  in  the  avocado  industry.  That  is  so  that \\neverybody sells their avocadoes directly without having to go through brokers hence making \\nmore money. \\n\\nAny legislation that will come into this House aims at supporting and actualising the \\npromises made by the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Government and our President. So \\nlong as it is serving our people, they can count on my support. I also assure our Kigumo people \\nthat their interests of being represented will be well done. On legislative functions, I will make \\nsure that laws passed here also support and favour us. I assure them that we shall oversee the \\nGovernment.  \\nI thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Member for Dagoretti South. \\n \\n \\nHon. John Kiarie (Dagoretti South, UDA): Hon. Deputy Speaker, I take this very early \\nopportunity to, first, congratulate you. You are legendary. You are one of the few Kenyans I \\nknow who have served in all the three Arms of the Government. We saw you do some amazing \\nwork in the Executive. We know you did some great leadership in the Judiciary and you are \\nnow in the legislative Arm of Government as the Deputy Speaker. I take this opportunity on \\nbehalf of the people of Dagoretti South to profusely congratulate you on ascending to the very \\nhigh office of Deputy Speaker of this House. In the same breath, I congratulate the Rt. Hon. \\nMoses Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula on being elected overwhelming as the Speaker of the 13th Parliament. This \\nis my first address in this House on a substantive issue. So, I take this opportunity to thank the \\npeople of Dagoretti South Constituency, who decided that kweli it is time for us to get back to \\nBunge and do that which we had started in the last term.   \\n\\nOn the speech by the President, I want to concretise it into thematic areas. I was able to \\nnote that the speech by the President was succinct. It was short, sweet and to the point and after \\nall was said and done, out of the many paragraphs, one is able to summarise it into seven very \\nprofound thematic areas. His Excellency, the President was able to speak on agriculture and \\nfood security and the grand plan. He not only spoke about it but he has already sanctioned it \\nthrough  executive  action  because  we  saw  him  moving  our  subsidies  from  consumption  to \\nproduction. On that alone, I commend His Excellency, the President.   \\n\\nThis is a man who was elected on the back of a wave of a campaign that was driven by \\nthe hustlers of this country. The President was careful to recognise that there is a sector called \\nthe  Small  and  Micro  Enterprises  (SMEs)  and  to  it,  he  spoke  elaborately  about  the  plan  of \\ninvesting in this very critical sector. Of importance to me is the fact that this House has a role \\nto play in connecting the drive on SMEs with the Technical and Vocational Education Training \\ninstitutions (TVETs) and the installation of institutions that will be used for incubation and for \\napprenticeship for the people in the SMEs. \\n\\nFor  people  like  us  who  represent  urban  constituencies,  we  took  note  of  the  great \\ninvestment  in  the  Hustler  Fund  and  the  Enterprise  Fund,  which  we  know  is  going  to  spur \\ndevelopment  in  this  area.  I  pride  myself  as  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwomen  representative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  of  the  people  of \\nDagoretti South Constituency. I am a feminist and admittedly so, so I was very excited when \\nHis Excellency the President took up the women agenda. We know what the plans are and we \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c6th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                   6 \\n\\n \\nsaw  them  when  he  signed  charters  with  the  women  of  this  country.  Not  only  did  he  sign  a \\ncharter but he also transformed it into an agenda in his manifesto, which ended up becoming \\nthe Kenya Kwanza Plan that we shall be implementing. I commit as a feminist and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwomen \\nrepresentative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the people of Dagoretti South to support any legislative agenda that will push \\nthe women agenda in this House. \\n\\nHis  Excellency  the  President  was  keen  to  bring  up  the  health  agenda.  When  each \\nMember of Parliament here does their clinics on Monday mornings, the biggest issue they have \\nto contend with is how to pay hospital bills and bills for the deceased.  This  country cannot \\nafford  to  continue  paying  for  health  out  of  pocket.  When  his  Excellency  the  President  will \\nchampion Bills to reform the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) in this House, I shall \\nbe  a  champion.  I  will  champion  for  the  reform  of  the  health  sector,  and  more  so  health \\nfinancing. I commend the President for putting it in his speech. \\n\\nWe have been told that there is a taskforce coming up to review the Competency Based \\nCurriculum (CBC).  So, when it came up as an agenda on the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, I was excited \\nbecause some of us have children in Grade Six this year. We want to know what CBC means \\nfor a young child of 12 years taken to a high school and has to be in school with students who \\nare probably 18 or 19 years. So, when we shall come to the issue of education, I know even \\nthis House shall be involved in recommending some changes to CBC form of education and \\nthis taskforce will be one of the things that will be a highlight in the life of this Parliament.   \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency  the  President  applied  himself  on  the  issue  of \\nInformation Communication Technology (ICT) and the digital economy.  This is a sector that \\nbrought me up. I would like to report to this House that in the world that we are living today, \\nideas and data are the currency.  If we do not take note of the new and emerging economies in \\nthe digital and creative economy, we shall not be fit for any purpose in a time such as this.  So, \\nit  is  my  joy  and  celebration  that  His  Excellency  the  President,  through  his  very  important \\nspeech, was able to address the issues of the creative digital economy.   \\n\\nThe question on whether telcos should continue operating as banks, whether they can \\nbe regulatable when they operate by the Communications Authority of Kenya while they are \\nalso conducting monetary business that should be overseen and regulated by the Central Bank \\nof Kenya (CBK) is an issue of concern. The issue of Fuliza and digital loans is critical. We \\ncannot have a country that is listed as people who cannot pay loans. The idea of moving the \\nCredit  Reference  Bureau  (CRB)  to  a  credit  system  was  very  welcome  as  an  idea  from  His \\nExcellency the President. I know this House shall have a bite on this issue. I know that our \\nMembers who represent Kenyans and have been listed, and who have been condemned shall \\nbe contributing to it. \\n\\nFor me, the housing issue is critical. I hail from this city that brought me up. I do not \\nknow of any other place. As people retreat to their rural areas, Nairobi is my ushago so to say.  \\nSo, when the issue of housing and settlement was brought up by His Excellency the President, \\nI was keen to know what he had to say. I picked out a great idea of aggregation, specialisation \\nand standardisation that speaks to the people of Dagoretti South, who are worldly renowned as \\nartisans and as Jua Kali Sector idea leaders. Hon. Deputy Speaker, if you drive on your way \\nfrom Adams Arcade round-about all the way to Karen, you shall see the street lined-up on both \\nsides of the road by Jua Kali artisans. These are people who will benefit from the housing and \\nsettlement plan.   \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, because there is no much time to lay out everything I wanted to \\nsay, I would leave it at the issue of corruption.  Hon.  Fatuma Mohammed from Migori County \\nsaid that His Excellency the President had nothing to say about corruption. That speech was \\nladen with issues if addressed would address the main issue of corruption. Even as we address \\ncorruption,  we  need  to  remind  ourselves  what  Mother  Theresa  told  us  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  that,  whatever  you \\nresist, persists. We cannot keep glorifying corruption by giving it a high pedestal. Let us start \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Let us make institutions that are titled with the word integrity and let \\nus stop glorifying corruption as a name. The more we glorify it, the more it persists. It is upon \\nus to align ourselves with integrity, ethics and morals but not to keep glorifying corruption. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I thank you for giving me this opportunity. I take this chance to \\ncongratulate each and every Member of Parliament who was elected and I wish you a good\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\nHon. Deputy Speaker:  Thank you Member for Dagoretti South for your kind words.  \\n\\nI would now call the Member for Suna West.  \\n\\nHon. Peter Masara (Suna West): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for giving me this \\n\\nopportunity to contribute in this House. \\n\\n First, I congratulate you for being elected the Deputy Speaker of the 13th Parliament. \\nBefore I say something about today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agenda, let me thank the great people of Suna West for \\nelecting me for the second time to represent them in this very important House.  \\n\\nI thank the  youth,  religious leaders, professionals, business  community and all those \\nwho worked 24 hours to ensure that my second victory is one which I am not taken to court to \\nbe challenged.  \\n\\nAs I continue to contribute to today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Motion, there are several areas I want to mention, \\nmore  particularly  on  the  youths.  We  are  talking  about  the  Hustler  Fund  according  to  the \\nPresident\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech. Some hustlers are old men and women, and the youths. I however want to \\nparticularly put emphasis on the issue of the youths of this country. Many were promised that \\nthere would be pesa mfukoni while some were to be given Kshs6,000 every month. All of them \\nare, however, now lamenting. If you read the Bible, the Book of Habakkuk, they do not know \\nif there is money in their pockets or at the end of the month they are going to get the promised \\nKshs6,000. Can we not formulate a policy to have a youth commission that will ensure that \\nsmall and medium enterprises money is given to the youth? This is because they do not have \\nenterprise startup capital. As we move forward and discuss the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, we should \\nalso put emphasis on the issues of youths so that they can be part and parcel of this country.  \\n\\nI agree with what the President said on the Universal Health Coverage. We want to try \\nand  increase  the  number  of  people  being  covered  by  the  National  Hospital  Insurance  Fund \\n(NHIF). However, let us also consider the standards of health facilities in this country. We have \\nvery few referral hospitals in this country. If we do not increase their numbers to enable every \\ncounty to have a well-equipped hospital, we will continue losing our citizens simply because \\nthey cannot access standardized health services. On the same note, we may talk of Universal \\nHealth Coverage but what about the health workers? Do they have good representation? As we \\ntalk,  the  47  counties  are  not  able  to  manage  our  health  workers  well.  This  House  should, \\ntherefore,  consider  forming  a health commission  so that they  can deal  with  issues of health \\nworkers in this country.  \\n\\nOn the same note, I want to talk about infrastructure. The President did not cover this \\nin his Speech. The people of Suna West were expecting a lot in terms of infrastructure. We \\nhave a major road in Suna West called Kababu-Piny Oyie-Adera Road which is still unusable.  \\nWe expected a lot of money to be allocated to infrastructure so that we can benefit to enable us \\nmake this road to bitumen standard.  \\n\\nWe have civil servants in this country and as we all know, the cost of living is so high \\nwhile  salaries  remain  the  same.  We  need  to  look  into  our  civil  servants,  and  our  men  and \\nwomen in uniform when we discuss economy issues. This is because in their circumstances, \\nvery few people think about them.  \\n\\nOur  education  system  is  confusing.  Let  us  formulate  policies  which  can  guarantee \\nstandardized education. Today, even the professionals are not sure of what is going to happen \\ntomorrow. January is just next door but we do not know the system we will use. Above all, the \\nGovernment  has  tried  over  a  period  of  time  on  the  issues  of  free  secondary  education.

Something has to be done about it.  \\n\\nWe also need to do something on the price of unga. Currently, it is trading at Kshs200 \\nplus. School principals are buying maize from the same market but the capitation allocation, \\nwhich was done 10 years ago, still remains constant. Are we doing favour and justice to these \\nschools  and  students  or  we  are  losing  it?  As  legislators,  I  believe  we  can  do  something  to \\nsalvage this country.  \\n\\nI want to talk about the KRA issue that was mentioned world over. I have been doing \\nsome small research world over and there is no friendly tax collector.  A tax collector is always \\none. The best thing that can be done is to come up with good  policies where those who are \\npaying tax can see or feel value for it; and by doing so, nobody will complain about it. We need \\nto see good roads, hospitals and salary increments.  \\n\\nOn the issue of security, what are we doing for our people who are not secured? Are we \\nincreasing the number of vehicles for police officers? Are we increasing the salaries for men \\nand women in uniform? Are we jailing criminals or letting them go scot-free? Our courts should \\ndo something about the people responsible for insecurity in this country.  \\n\\nFinally, I congratulate each and every Member of this 13th Parliament for being elected. \\nI remind them that as we are now being celebrated, we will become the enemies of the public \\nthe  next  day  if  we  do  not  meet  their  expectations.  We  need  to  do  things  which  we  will  be \\nremembered for, whether in this House or out there. We must develop our people to an extent \\nthat even when you are no longer in Parliament, people talk about you. That way, people will \\nremember you many years after you exit the position of leadership.  \\n\\nI thank my ODM party and my leader Hon. Rt. Raila Amollo Odinga for giving me an \\nopportunity to serve the people of Suna West as an elected Member through his party. The last \\ntime I was in this House as an Independent Member of Parliament, I faced so many challenges. \\nI pray that the current Independent Members do not face the same. We need to strengthen our \\nparties  so  that  democracy  can  prevail  in  this  country.  We  need  people  like  Hon.  Rt.  Raila \\nAmollo Odinga to be respected and given opportunity as the few statesmen we have in Africa \\ntoday.  \\n\\nAs we are about to talk about Azimio la Umoja and Kenya Kwanza, we must know that \\nthere are people who contributed to the liberation we are enjoying today. Sometime back, there \\nwere areas which could not develop themselves because there was no devolution. Some people \\ndied because of fighting for devolution. If I recall, someone like Dr. Odhiambo Mbai was killed \\nbecause he was agitating and fighting for the people of Kenya to be liberated for the second \\ntime.  \\n\\nNobody  was mentioned  as a candidate for  the Ministry of Devolution  and Planning. \\nThat worries me because I was the last Mayor of Migori, and I know what devolution can do. \\nSomething, therefore, needs to be done so that we have a powerful Minister to head the Ministry \\nof  Devolution  and  Planning  so  that  we  can  strengthen  our  devolved  units  for  people  to  get \\nservices irrespective of whether they are in or out of Government.  \\n\\nThank you for giving me the opportunity. \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  What  is  your  point  of  order,  Hon.  Member  for  Eldas?  I  am \\n\\nsorry Members; it is not a point of order. You can go ahead and contribute. \\n\\nHon. Adan Keynan (Eldas, JP): Thank you for giving me an opportunity to contribute \\n\\nto this important debate.  \\n\\nI take this opportunity to congratulate you for being among the few lady representatives \\nfor the 13th Parliament. I also congratulate all Members here for having been elected to the 13th \\nParliament.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, an elective position is the most difficult and sometimes the most \\nsought-after job. This is why I welcome my colleagues to the 13th Parliament. Enjoy both the \\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I am sure in due course you will realise that there are \\ncertain things that we must not take for granted.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, before I go back to the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, I would like to thank \\nthe people of Wajir West. I know we have our able Member Hon. Muliro Farah \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Hon. Yusuf \\nFarah \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that was my first constituency that showed me the door to politics. I was a Member of \\nParliament twice, elected actually for 10 years then later on I moved to Eldas where I am doing \\nmy fifth term as a representative of the people of Eldas.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I must appreciate that at one time the current Head of State and \\nI  were  classified  as  young  legislators  who  benefitted  from  a  programme  called  The  Young \\nLegislators Programme sponsored by the United States of America (USA) Embassy. We went \\naround  globe-trotting  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  being  newly  elected  young  Members  of \\nParliament. That was in 1998. We went to the USA where we visited over 18 States and that \\nProgramme opened the doors for us.  \\n \\nOne thing that I appreciate and felt very good about this particular speech is respect for \\nthe  separation  of  institutional  roles.  Those  of  us  who  were  there  and  participated  in  the \\nmidwifing  of  the  current  Constitution,  one  of  the  things  that  the  August  2010  Constitution \\nemphasised on is respect for the rule of law.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, you are a lawyer with many years of experience.  The opening \\nchapter  in  Article  1  emphasizes  on  representation  and  clearly  spells  out  the  nexus  between \\nrepresentation and sovereignty. That is one Article that all of us must accept and pursue to the \\nletter.  At  times  somebody  will  invoke  Articles  95  and  96  and  say  the  role  of  a  Member  of \\nParliament  (MP)  is  not  clearly  defined.  Unfortunately,  the  Salaries  and  Remuneration \\nCommission (SRC) up to now is yet to accept the role of Members of Parliament. It is not just \\nlimited to representation.  \\n \\nAn MP is an embodiment of everything in the Kenyan society. That is why Hon. Deputy \\nSpeaker, the best diplomats or economic advisors are found amongst Members of Parliament. \\nKenya  is  a  premier  nation.  One  of  the  things  that  the  President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Speech  emphasized  was \\ndevelopment of different sectors: the economic, security, infrastructural and education sectors. \\nAll these require an informed, knowledgeable and persistent Member of Parliament through \\nlegislation  and  oversight.  That  is  why  without  the  National  Government  Constituencies \\nDevelopment Fund (NG-CDF), there would be no representation. I will ask my colleagues here \\nto agree with me that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo NG-CDF, no representation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This is because without it, there would \\nbe no need of being an MP. In the 1990s, when there was no NG-CDF, MPs were miserable. \\nThe presence of the NG-CDF has given life, human dignity and taste to representation.  \\n \\nWhatever  you do, regardless of the differences in our political  persuasions, the NG-\\nCDF must remain an integral part of our day-to-day activities. That is why I appreciated when \\nHis Excellency the President talked about retention of the NG-CDF. For that to happen, it is \\nup to all of us to pursue it to the letter. Otherwise, dictates from the Treasury mandarins will \\nalways be there and they are loyal to their own interests. For us, our loyalty is to those who \\nbrought us to this House. That is a very important ingredient in your life.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  coming  back  to  Kenya,  just  some  few  days  before  the  final \\nresults were announced, the atmosphere was pregnant with so many rumours and speculations. \\nThe people were speculating on what might happen. There were trivial advices and so many \\nother challenges. However, one thing that we must appreciate is the resilience of the Kenyan \\npeople  and  the  maturity  of  our  democracy.  Kenya  is  not  just  a  country  by  name  but  it  is  a \\npremier republic. Today  in  Ethiopia, an eventful  day is happening because of the  effects  of \\nSafaricom diplomacy which is being felt in the entire Africa. We are going to be very proud of \\nthat event because soon the benefits of Safaricom are going to be felt all over.  \\n \\nEqually,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  Kenya  is  an  economic,  security  and  diplomatic  hub. \\nThese are things we must appreciate as citizens and representatives of the people. The other \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

What we need to benefit from \\nthis  is  our  diaspora  diplomacy.  I  know  very  soon  there  will  be  an  inclusion  of  diaspora \\ndiplomacy as one of the tenets of our foreign policy but before that is domesticated, the diaspora \\ndiplomacy has greatly contributed and improved our economy. That is something that each one \\nof us here as Parliamentarians and part of parliamentary diplomacy must be prepared to engage \\nin. In this era of representation, Parliamentarians are the best diplomats in other jurisdictions \\nand  democracies.  However,  in  the  Kenyan  context,  the  Parliamentarian  is  not  regarded  as \\nsomebody who is well informed. This is because of the basic definitions that other people were \\nnot friendly to Parliament previously and the same was projected to the Members of Parliament. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, there is the issue of drought, which His Excellency the President \\nhas alluded to. However, my colleagues from Northern Kenya must accept that the era of food \\nrelief must come to an end. Instead, we need to pursue water availability and irrigation, revival \\nof  Kenya  Meat  Commission  (KMC)  and  Kenya  Livestock  Marketing  Authority  (KLMA). \\nThese things have died over the years. In 1968, Kenya was a leading beef exporter to the whole \\nworld. Today we get our beef from Botswana. In 1968, Kenya was a leading donor nation. In \\nfact, our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was at par with that of South Korea. Today, South \\nKorea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GDP is five times that of Kenya and yet they have no known natural resource. These \\nare issues we must deal with and address as citizens of the Republic of Kenya.  \\nFinally,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  we  are  approaching  a  very  difficult  time  because  of \\n \\nserious  rise  in  inflation,  economic  stagnation  and  unemployment.  These  are  issues  we  can \\nsalvage if we put our heads together. We are surrounded by countries that have had serious \\nsecurity  challenges  and  that  is  why  Kenya  remains  a  very  important  component  of  the \\ninternational  community.  That  is  why  I  believe  in  their  own  wisdom,  the  international \\ncommunity decided to elect Kenya as a member of the United Nations Security Council. That \\nis  not  just  a  mere  achievement.  It  is  a  serious  achievement  which  we  must  be  prepared  to \\njealously protect.  \\n \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  this  is  just  the  beginning  of  this  Session.  Eventually,  we  will \\nbegin  to  learn  and  appreciate  each  other.  However,  my  final  word  today  on  this  is  that  as \\nMembers of the 13th Parliament, we are one family. Regardless of our political persuasions, we \\nare one family and outside there, we will be treated as Members of one family. Whatever we \\ndo, let us engage soberly and with dignity while appreciating our roles. There is a time I was \\nthe  youngest  Member  here.  Today,  I  am  among  the  oldest  Members  of  Parliament.  Time \\nchanges.  These  are  realities  that  we  must  expect  and  appreciate;  that  my  contribution  and \\nexperience will add value to you. Also, your coming in will add value to me. Ultimately, we \\nhave the best representation in the 13th Parliament.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Garissa County. \\n \\n \\nHon. Amina Siyad (Garissa CWR, JP): Thank you Hon. Deputy Speaker. My name is \\nAmina Udgoon, the Woman Representative of Garissa County. First and foremost, I would like \\nto thank the people of Garissa County for voting me in. I am a desert flower, a young lady and \\na humanitarian before I became a politician. Thank you. congratulations for being elected as \\nthe Hon. Deputy Speaker. As a woman, I am proud of you.  \\n\\nAbout the speech of the President, it was short, concise and to the point. It is largely \\npeople-centred  and  it  is  about  Wanjiku.  It  reflected  the  aspirations  of  the  new  President  in \\ncharge of the lives of the ordinary citizens. However, there were notable gaps. A million plus \\ncitizens in more than 23 counties are being affected by drought. More so the people of Garissa \\nCounty and the larger Northern Kenya are staring at starvation. Mothers and children are the \\nworst affected, especially lactating mothers and infants.  \\n\\nThe President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech  ought  to  have largely  centred on this recurring problem  that \\naffects the people of Northern Kenya every year. The situation is grim, horrific and desperate. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Some things need to be done to save the lives \\nof millions of people. I expected His Excellency the President to touch on these serious issues \\nsince he was addressing us as the peoples\\xe2\\x80\\x99 representatives. Under our Constitution, the State is \\nresponsible for the lives of all Kenyans. Efforts must be made to ensure that no Kenyans lose \\ntheir lives because of hunger. I  must  commend  the  Government  for  the  little  but  necessary \\neffort it has initiated by sending relief food to the affected people. However, more needs to be \\ndone. I thank His Excellency the Deputy President, Rigathi Gachagua aka Riggy-G for leading \\nthis exercise. We hope the new Cabinet will address this issue. \\n \\nAnother important issue His Excellency the President forgot is the good message of \\nunity in our country. He is no doubt the President of 50 plus million Kenyans; those who voted \\nfor him and those who did not. Without commitment to the unity of the nation, the Government \\nmight not succeed in its endeavours. The unity of our people is paramount. The President is a \\nsymbol of national unity under our Constitution. We pray for him and our nation and expect \\nhim to unify Kenyans. \\n \\nmajority, and hope that the law will be respected and Azimio named the majority party.  \\n \\nSpeaker. \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Thank  you,  Member  for  Garissa  County  for  being  brief. \\n \\nMembers, I think the reason why we had the Procedural Motion on limitation of debate was to \\nensure that as many Members as possible have an opportunity to speak, particularly those who \\nare making their maiden speeches.  I can see there are people who have already spoken, but \\ntheir names are appearing. Kindly pull out your cards. I have a very good memory, in case you \\nthought I have forgotten. For example, the Member for Emurua Dikirr, I can see your name \\nhere and you have already spoken. Member for Kigumo, also remove your card. I will find out.  \\nI now call the Member for Elgeyo Marakwet County, please, proceed. \\n \\n \\nHon. Caroline Ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99elechei (Elgeyo Marakwet CWR, Independent): Thank you, Hon. \\nDeputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to make my maiden speech. First and foremost, \\nI  thank  God  and  the  people  of  Elgeyo  Marakwet  for  electing  me  to  this  august  House.  My \\njourney here was not easy. I come from Elgeyo Marakwet County, which is the \\xe2\\x80\\x98bedroom\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of \\nthe United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Party. But the people believed in me and voted for me \\noverwhelmingly, and I thank God for this and appreciate them. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I come from a county with many challenges, and one sector that \\nis  facing  many  challenges  is  agriculture.  About  100  per  cent  of  the  residents  of  Elgeyo \\nMarakwet  are farmers who either keep domestic  animals,  or grow crops.  The issue that has \\nbeen affecting my people recently is that of fertiliser prices, and I applaud and commend the \\nPresident for talking about subsidising farming inputs. I believe that going forward, the life of \\na farmer will be as rosy as anybody who lives in the city; enjoying what comes from the farm \\nwithout knowing the hustle and bustle that farmers go through. \\n \\nI also want to assure the people of Elgeyo Marakwet that we will handle the issue of \\nbanditry in Kerio Valley. This is because they do not enjoy peace because others have taken \\nthe  law  into  their  hands,  and  walk  around  brandishing  firearms  the  way  they  want.  Going \\nforward, I believe that through this House, I will bring legislation to ensure that we can live \\nlike other people.  \\n \\nIt is about time that the issue of banditry in Kerio Valley was categorised as terrorism.  \\nThis is because a bandit is more than a terrorist. If you can remember in the last year, some \\npeople were killed in Kerio Valley by people with illegal firearms in their hands. The number \\nof those killed was more than those killed by the Al Shabaab in the last five years. So, the Al \\nShabaab and bandits are all in the same category. Through this House, I will ensure that we \\ncategorise bandits as terrorists so that the issue of banditry can come to an end. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The previous Government massacred this exercise at the expense \\nof the benefit to the people. I will ensure those projects are revived, so that they can help the \\npeople to irrigate their farms. \\nAllow  me  to  thank  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Kenya  for  remembering  mama \\n \\nmbogas and hustlers. In this country, the gap between the rich and poor is widening day and \\nnight.  This  is  because  the  poor  become  poorer  daily.  However,  through  the  Hustler  Fund,  I \\nbelieve that the people of Elgeyo Marakwet will benefit by using the revolving fund to improve \\ntheir lives. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, since I know there is a queue of so many people who want to \\ngive their maiden speeches, I wish to donate the extra time I have so that even my Member of \\nParliament (MP) for Marakwet West can have a chance to give his maiden speech.  \\nI appreciate and thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, if you come to side-talk me requesting for time \\nto  speak,  you  are  automatically  disqualified.  This  is  because  I  do  not  want  to  give  the \\nimpression that if you side-talk me, then you get an opportunity. So, if you come here, you are \\ndisqualified.  Let us have the Member for Nairobi County. If your card is not working, ask the \\nClerk-at-the-Table or the Serjeant-at-Arms to assist you. Let us have Hon. Passaris. \\nHon. Esther Passaris (Nairobi CWR, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. First \\n \\nand foremost, allow me to start by congratulating you for being elected as the Deputy Speaker \\nof  this  august  House.  I  also  want  to  congratulate  our  Speaker,  Hon.  Moses  Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula  for \\nbeing elected, and every Member of Parliament who has made it back. It is said that we had \\nthe highest number of returnees to this Parliament.  \\n \\nI also want to congratulate my worthy opponent, hon. Millicent Omanga, because we \\nhad  an  amazing  campaign  together.  We  did  not  tread  on  each  other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  toes.  She  accepted, \\nconceded defeat and congratulated me. I think this is the kind of politics that we want.  \\n \\nI also want to congratulate the country, because it has grown in democracy. We had a \\npeaceful  election  and  there  were  many  people  who  were  hurt  by  this  election;  over  seven \\nmillion  people  but  we  stood  for  the  democracy,  which  is  the  respect  that  we  all  have.  The \\npeople  that  supported  Raila  Amolo  Odinga  and  the  Azimio  fraternity,  and  the  respect  for \\ndemocracy. I want to congratulate Kenyans for the peaceful election. We are a model for the \\nentire world. \\n \\nI also take this opportunity to thank the Nairobi voters; those who voted for me, those \\nwho did not vote for me, and those who did not  show up to vote. We understand that there \\nmight have been a lot of voter apathy, and it is something that we, as leaders, will strive to \\nwork for; and make you understand that voting is an important exercise. A total of 8 million \\npeople did not show up to vote, and that should be a concern to every elected leader.  \\n \\n Now  we  are  here  to  discuss  the  President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Speech.  While  we  are  looking  at  the \\nPresident\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, I would like to first congratulate the President for being sworn in as the \\nPresident of this country. In this country after an election, we try to come together. Today as \\nwe sit and discuss the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, he talked about and touched on a number of issues. \\nFor me, it is not about whether it was a long a speech or a short one. What I took back is the \\nfact  that  he  wanted  to  ensure  that  we  continue  the  programmes  that  we  had  in  the  12th \\nParliament like housing food security and infrastructure, among others. I believe that kind of \\ncontinuity is important. \\n\\nAs  a  women  representative,  when  I  came  into  office,  I  found  projects  that  my \\npredecessor  had  started  but  had  not  been  completed.  I  continued  with  them.  That  is  very \\nimportant. We recently accompanied the President as he was launching a housing project. That \\nis a project that started in the last administration, where he was the Deputy President. He wants \\nto continue with. I like the fact that he actually spoke to the point that the rental income will be \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Nairobi has a slum in every corner. The \\npeople of Nairobi want better housing. That was part of the four agendas of the Government, \\nand I believe that continuity of programs that are good will be very favourable for this country.  \\nThe area that I have a problem when it comes to food security is our rush for Genetically \\nModified Organisms (GMO). I believe that in the whole world, if you go to Europe right now, \\nthe  priciest  commodities  are  the  ones  that  are  organic.  When  we  start  thinking  of  GMOs,  I \\nbelieve that we should start treading slowly. As much as we want to feed our people, we have \\nto make sure that we understand that, as a country, we do not just want to feed ourselves but to \\nexport our products. We have to think twice and we have to educate our people. With the rising \\ncases of cancer, if we rush to GMOs, we might also end up having a situation where we are \\nincreasing  our  medical  costs  and  we  also  have  Universal  Health  Coverage  (UHC)  as  a  big \\nprogramme for this country. \\n\\nOn the idea of savings, the President said that when you retire, your National Social \\nSecurity Fund (NSSF) contributions will not be sufficient for you in retirement at the rate of \\nKshs200. He talked about Kshs2 and Ksh1 coming from the State. That is very good idea. But \\nat the same time, what we have to realise is that if we do not handle corruption, which is the \\nbig elephant in the room, then we will be faced with the situation where people are saving and \\nthe money is being siphoned out and not invested. I believe that when we save for retirement, \\none of the things that we should offer our citizens is affordable housing. We see a lot of citizens \\nthat have worked very hard, but they can hardly live on the retirement benefits that they get \\nfrom the Government.  \\n\\nWhen it comes to the borrowing that we have in this county, the President touched on \\nreducing the budget by over Kshs300 billion. The excess that we have to borrow every year of \\nKshs900 billion is reduced by Kshs300 billion. That is the good initiative but then, we have to \\nask ourselves where we are going to find that money. I believe that this country loses so much \\nmore than the Kshs300 billion to corruption. So, while we are strengthening our institutions, \\nlike the Judiciary, the Police Service and we are giving them budgets so that they can sustain \\nthemselves, we have to deal with corruption. \\n\\nAn  area  that  I  had  hoped  the  President  would  look  into  is  investment  and  investor \\nconfidence. This country right now makes it very difficult for people to invest and bring money \\ninto the country. You have a situation where if you want to deposit any money, the maximum \\nthat  you  are  allowed  to  deposit  is  USD10,000. Many  Kenyans  have  got  money  outside  this \\ncountry, and they cannot come and bring it. We desperately need that money to come into this \\ncountry. I believe that we should allow some kind of amnesty to bring in the money and remove \\nthe obstacle where you have to deposit only USD10,000, and provide sufficient documentation \\nfor it. The problem is that it is stifling many people who are coming into this country to make \\ninvestments.  I believe that not  every amount of  money that comes into this country of over \\nUSD10,000 could be stolen money. But we are making it very difficult for people to come into \\nthis country to invest because of the red tape that we have.  \\n\\nKenya is a blessed country, but we have a situation right now which is drought. We \\nneed an intervention from the Government. It is sad to see that right now, Kenyans do not have \\nfood. In so many parts of this country, children are dying of malnutrition because their parents \\ncannot afford to give them healthy nutritious food. People are dying because there is no food \\nin the country.  \\n\\nSo, while we talk about the fact that this country does not have enough food, I think the \\nmost  important  thing  that  we  have  to  address  as  a  country  is  also  family  planning.  At  the \\nmoment, we do not have enough family planning in this country. We do not buy commodities. \\nFamily planning is dependent on donors. Every country has to plan its population. In Kenya, \\nwe have failed to plan our population. In the 1960\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, when Tom Mboya was asked by the British \\nBroadcasting Corporation (BBC): \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat programmes do you have for your country?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The first \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It is really sad to see a \\nnumber of women having children, not because they want children, but because they did not \\nhave access to information on family planning. They did not have access to the commodities. \\nThose women have children and they are condemned to abject poverty. \\n\\n  \\n\\n[The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Gladys Boss) left the Chair) \\n\\n \\n\\n[The Speaker (Hon. Moses Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\nI know we say that we are a Christian country, but I want you to understand that even \\nGod himself was a family planner. He believes in family planning. In the cycle of a woman, \\nthere is a period where she cannot have a child. As a country, we need to plan our population \\nso that we can actually look after our environment and also protect the citizens of this country \\nto be able to prosper.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity.  \\nThe Hon. Speaker: Thank you. Member for Kandara, proceed.  \\nHon. Members: Ruling!  \\nHon. Speaker: After the Member for Kandara, you will get what you are asking for. \\nHon.  Alice  Wahome  (Kandara,  UDA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker.  I  take  this \\nopportunity to congratulate you on your election by this House as our Speaker. Having said \\nthat,  I  also  congratulate  your  Deputy,  Hon.  Gladys  Shollei,  for  being  elected  as  the  Deputy \\nSpeaker. May I then also go further to congratulate each and every Member of this House for \\na very hard job to ensure that they were elected to this House. I congratulate my colleagues, \\nthe  women  Hon.  Members  who  have  been  elected  from  the  29  constituencies.  Those \\nconstituencies  have  agreed  to  elect  women  MPs.  We  are  29  and  I  recognise  that  we  lost  8 \\nwomen by failure to retain their seats. In the last House, we were 23, and I was the Chairperson \\nof that caucus. We are now 29 women. We hope to retain and get an addition. We appreciate \\nthose constituencies that continue to elect women, and specifically my constituency, Kandara, \\nfor giving me a third honourable term. I will forever remain grateful. It is an unusual situation \\nfor a woman to be elected for three terms. Where I come from, we are still very conservative \\nand,  therefore,  Kandara  Constituency  has  demonstrated  progressive  thinking  and  action \\ntowards political development. Thank you.  \\n\\nI  also  want  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  His  Excellency  the  President  of  the \\nRepublic of Kenya, Dr.  William Samoei Ruto  for seeing it fit to  appoint me as the Cabinet \\nSecretary (CS) for the Ministry of Water, Sanitation and Irrigation, subject to the approval of \\nthis House. The approval is a very important process, and nobody should take this House for \\ngranted. Even though some of us have been appointed, I look forward to appearing before the \\nrelevant committee. Those who have said that they will approve my name, thank you. I will \\ntruly appreciate. \\n\\nLet me make my contribution on the Address by the President. I know that I may not \\nhave much time, if I am approved by this House. I am grateful for this opportunity to contribute \\nto the address by His Excellency. To the new Members who may not know me, my name is \\nAlice Muthoni Wahome, Member for Kandara Constituency. Kandara is in Murang\\xe2\\x80\\x99a County, \\nfor record purposes. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, I think it is important to read this Address. I know that we all listened to \\nthe Address by His Excellency the President. One key thread that has come out for me is this: \\nHe spoke about ensuring that he will run a Government that is transparent and accountable. \\nThe role of this House is to hold the Government to account. Therefore, for His Excellency to \\ncome out in his own address to uphold the House, and to continue to urge the House to ensure \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Speaker,  the  President  also  said  that  he  hopes  legislative  proposal  from  his \\nGovernment  will  receive  a  bipartisan  approach  in  a  bipartisan  debate,  noting  that  whatever \\nproposals are brought by the Government are proposals for the good and for the interest of the \\npeople  of  Kenya.  I,  therefore,  think  it  is  important  as  legislators  to  isolate  politics  from \\ndevelopment. We all agree that we can debate, we can disagree as we have done before; we in \\nfact even haggle and push, while noting that as legislators, we have a duty to ensure that the \\nGovernment  delivers  on  the  promises  that  it  has  made.  One  key  issue  is  the  promise  as  a \\ncoalition to  look  at  the economy  from  a bottom  up approach. Therefore,  we expect  that the \\nGovernment will continue to look at projects and programmes that will ensure that it lifts the \\npeople from the bottom upwards, while ensuring that where the economy is hurting most is \\naddressed as soon as possible. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, the address by the President also  speaks to reducing the borrowing in \\nthis country. The President, particularly seems to detest the fact that the country has found itself \\nborrowing to finance recurrent expenditure. No country can be proud if it is borrowing instead \\nof putting money into development, production and industrial development. We are borrowing \\nto meet our recurrent expenditure. I appreciate the fact that it has been picked up very early in \\nthis Government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s term.   \\n\\nI have also looked at something relevant to the portfolio that I have been appointed to, \\nwhich includes, ensuring that there is access to water coverage. Access to water is currently at \\n60  per  cent.  The  Government  hopes  that  we  can  push  it  to  80  per  cent.  We  target  to  raise \\nKshs500 billion shillings, as stated in his Address. I hope that it will be possible to work with \\nthe Public Private Partnerships (PPP) and investors to raise the money. If I am approved by this \\nHouse, my office will remain open to MPs. I will make sure that we continue to work for the \\nbenefit of the people. I know that if the relationship between the Legislature and the Executive \\nis improved and enhanced, and if we ensure that there is a logical prudent reasonable working \\nrelationship, we can make a difference. We can deliver to the people, noting that where we are \\nas a country, nobody is proud of the fact that the country is on its knees literally, and that we \\nall need to work very hard. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, I want to finalise by saying that the people of Kandara are fairly anxious. \\nI  know  that  they  expected  a  five-year  term  from  me,  having  elected  me  with  quite  a  good \\nnumber of votes. Since campaigns are ongoing, I am sure I will have an opportunity to seek \\nthe approval of my constituents to be able to move to the next office. I know that they would \\nhave wanted me to serve for another term. I do not take it for granted that they gave me that \\nterm. I will be consulting them. We shall be engaging even before I come to appear before the \\nrelevant committee.  \\n\\nThank you, hon. Members for listening to me. I am here until you get me out of here. \\nHon. Speaker: Thank you, honourable Member for Kandara. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMESSAGE \\n\\n \\n\\nNOMINATION OF PERSONS FOR APPOINTMENT TO THE CABINET \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Hon.

Members, in the Message, His Excellency the President also conveys that he has \\nnominated Hon. Justin  Bedan Njoka Muturi, EGH, as the Attorney-General  and Ms.  Mercy \\nWanjau as the Secretary to the Cabinet. His Excellency the President now seeks the approval \\nof the National Assembly on the nominees for appointment to the said offices.  \\n\\nAs you are all aware, the Committee on Appointments is yet to be constituted, despite \\nthe provisions of Standing Order No.204(2) requiring that the Committee be appointed within \\nseven  days  on  the  assembly  of  a  new  House.  This  has  been  occasioned  by  the  fact  that  the \\nHouse  Business  Committee  (HBC)  is  yet  to  be  formed,  on  account  of  the  question  of  the \\nleadership of the majority party and the minority party, which I will rule on after this. \\n\\nIt is the HBC which is charged with the responsibility of nominating Members to sit in \\nthe Committee on Appointments, save for the slots reserved for the leadership of the House. \\nHaving resolved the stalemate in a short time to come, we will then move to the next level to \\nprocess these appointments.   \\n\\nSection  8  of  the  Public  Appointments  (Parliamentary  Approval)  Act,  2012  provides \\nthat, unless otherwise provided in law, the committee to which such nomination is referred to \\nshall  consider  the  matter  and  table  a  report  in  the  House  within  28  days.  It  is,  therefore, \\nimperative  that  once  the  Committee  on  Appointments  is  formed,  it  should  immediately \\ncommence the process  of consideration of the nominees to  enable speedy conclusion of the \\nvetting process within the set timelines.  \\n\\nI also direct the Clerk of the National Assembly to take the necessary steps and notify \\nthe nominees and the general public through an advertisement in daily newspapers of national \\ncirculation; and on the parliamentary website, of the time and place of holding the approval \\nhearings. This should be done by Friday, 7th October 2022 following which the Committee on \\nAppointments should commence the approval hearings.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Members stood at the entrance) \\n\\nCan the Members at the back take their seats?  \\nHon. Members, the following is a ruling on a matter that has been contested before the \\nHouse  and  in  correspondence  with  my  Office,  and  that  has  taken  centre-stage  in  the  public \\nmedia on the issue of the leadership of the National Assembly in the 13th Parliament.  \\n\\nHere I go. \\n \\n\\nCOMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR \\n\\n \\n\\nCONSIDERED RULING: LEADERSHIP OF THE NATIONAL \\n\\nASSEMBLY IN THE 13TH PARLIAMENT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Members, you will recall that during the afternoon sitting of Tuesday, 4th October \\n2022, I informed the House that a question had arisen on the manner of constituting the House \\nBusiness Committee, especially with  regard to  the membership reserved for the leaders and \\nwhips of the majority party and the minority party, respectively. In guiding the House on the \\nbusiness to be transacted before the establishment of the House Business Committee and the \\nmanner in which the business would be moved, I indicated that a question had arisen as to who \\nthe bona fide leader of the majority party in the House is. I proceeded to allow the House to \\naddress me on this matter and gave priority to the designated Party Leaders and Whips of the \\nKenya Kwanza Coalition and the Azimio La Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Political Party.  \\n\\nIn the debate that ensued, Hon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah tabled various coalition agreements \\nentered into by the constituent parties of the Kenya Kwanza Coalition and deposited with the \\nRegistrar of Political Parties. Hon. Silvanus Osoro also tabled letters relating to the matter, an \\nexcerpt of the minutes of the parliamentary group meeting and a list of attendees of the meeting \\nduring which the Party Leaders were elected. \\n\\nSimilarly, Hon. Opiyo Wandayi tabled a copy of a letter dated 7th September 2022 from \\nthe  Registrar  of  Political  Parties  (RPP)  addressed  to  the  Clerk  of  the  National  Assembly, \\nconveying what the Registrar termed as constituent parties of the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya \\nCoalition Party, the Kenya Kwanza Alliance (KKA), the name of one party not affiliated to \\nany coalition and an indication of parties that had filed constitutional petitions and objections \\nto their membership of the Azimio Coalition. \\n\\nWhile contributing to the debate, Hon. Junet Mohamed also tabled what he claimed to \\nbe the coalition agreement entered into between the constituent parties of the Azimio la Umoja \\n- One Kenya Coalition Party. Several other Members also weighed in on the matter, including \\nMember  for  Garissa  Township,  Hon.  Aden  Duale;  nominated  Member  Hon.  John  Mbadi; \\nMember for Ugenya, Hon.

Sarah  Korere;  Member  for  Ganze,  Hon.  Kenneth  Kazungu  Charo  and \\nMember for Alego Usonga, Hon.

Eve \\nObara;  Member  for  Kangundo,  Hon.  Fabian  Muli;  Member  for  Dagoretti  South,  Hon,  John \\nKiarie; Member for Embakasi South, Hon. Julius Mawathe; Member for Kiminini, Hon.

At  the  conclusion  of  the \\ndebate, I reserved my considered ruling for today. There are many other Members who rose on \\npoints of order. I need not mention them. \\n\\nFrom the onset, Hon. Members, permit me to amplify a portion of the contribution made \\nby Hon. John Mbadi, which is key to the resolution of this matter. The Hansard records Hon. \\nMbadi as having said that: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no contention over which Members constitute the leadership of both \\nthe  Kenya  Kwanza  Coalition  and  the  Azimio  la  Umoja  -  One  Kenya  Coalition.  The \\nonly contention that exists (and which formed the basis of the debate that ensued) is \\nover which of the two is the majority.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\nArticle 108 of the Constitution establishes the offices of party leaders in Parliament and \\noutlines the order of precedence to be observed in the National Assembly. The Article provides \\nas follows: \\n\\n108. \\n\\n(1) There shall be a leader of the majority party and a leader of the minority \\nparty. \\n(2) The leader of the majority party shall be the person who is the leader in \\nthe National Assembly of the largest party or coalition of parties. \\n(3) The leader of the minority party shall be the person who is the leader in \\nthe National Assembly of the second largest party or coalition of parties. \\n(4)  The  following  order  of  precedence  shall  be  observed  in  the  National \\nAssembly\\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\n\\n(a) the Speaker of the National Assembly; \\n(b) the leader of the majority party; and, \\n(c) the leader of the minority party. \\n\\nHon. Members, what is clear from the Constitution is that the Leader of the Majority \\nParty must lead either a party or a coalition of parties in the National Assembly. I invite the \\nHouse  to  note  my  emphasis  on  the  word  \\xe2\\x80\\x98either\\xe2\\x80\\x99.  Article  92  of  the  Constitution  mandates \\nParliament to enact legislation on various aspects of political parties. To this end, the Political \\nParties Act, 2011 was enacted. This law has been amended several times, including as late as \\nFebruary  this  year.  You  will  note  that  section  2  of  the  Act  defines  a  political  party  as  an \\nassociation of citizens, with an identifiable ideology or programme, constituted for the purpose \\nof influencing public policy or nominating candidates to contest elections. The term is further \\ndefined to include a coalition political party. Under the same section, a coalition is defined as \\nan alliance of two or more political parties formed for the purpose of pursuing a common goal \\nand is governed by a written agreement that is deposited with the Registrar. On the other hand, \\na coalition political party is defined as a coalition that is registered by the Registrar as a political \\nparty.  Interestingly,  section  10(1)  of  the  Act  allows  two  or  more  political  parties  to  form  a \\ncoalition or a coalition political party before or after an election, on condition that they deposit \\na coalition agreement with the Registrar. \\n\\nWhat I discern from this definition in section 10(1) of the Act is that Parliament in its \\nwisdom  legislated  as  follows:  That  two  or  more  political  parties  may  form  a  coalition  or  a \\ncoalition party and deposit a written agreement with the Registrar. Further, that a coalition of \\ntwo or more parties may register itself as a political party with the Registrar under the Act.

Junet Mohamed, he submitted names of leaders representing the Azimio la Umoja - One \\nKenya  Coalition  Party.  Curiously,  in  the  same  letter,  the  Member  signed  off  as  Secretary-\\nGeneral of the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Coalition. This begs the question whether Azimio \\nla Umoja One Kenya Coalition is a coalition, a political party or both. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn the debate on this matter, several Members argued that a coalition political party is \\na perfectly legal vehicle that was used in the just-concluded elections to allow individual and \\ncorporate  membership  within  a  coalition.  In  my  understanding  of  Sections  2  and  10  of  the \\nPolitical  Parties  Act,  Parliament  permitted  a  coalition  political  party  to  elect  to  assume  the \\ncharacter of either a party or a coalition. In the last general election, it is evident that Azimio \\nla Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Party elected to behave as several political parties in certain \\ncategories of elections and as one political party with regard to the presidential election. It is \\nwithout doubt that if it were to be considered as a political party, Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya \\nCoalition Party has no elected Member in this House today, as no Member was elected under \\nits banner. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nThis is easily discernible from Gazette Notice No.9950 and Gazette Notice No.9951 of \\n2022, both dated 23rd August 2022, and Gazette Notice No.10535 dated 5th September 2022, \\nin which the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) declared the persons \\nduly  elected  as  Members  of  this  House  and  their  respective  political  parties.  Further,  it  is \\nnotable that with  respect to  Members nominated to  this House, the Azimio la Umoja  - One \\nKenya Coalition Party elected to nominate Members under the names of its constituent parties. \\nThis can be seen in Gazette Notice No.10537 of 2022 dated 7th September 2022 and Gazette \\nNotice  No.10710  of  2022  dated  9th  September  2022.  The  Azimio  la  Umoja-One  Kenya \\nCoalition  Party  seems  to  have  elected  to  enter  this  House  in  both  elective  and  nominative \\npositions through its individual constituent parties. It is a clear demonstration of the Coalition \\nParty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  respect  for  freedom  of  association  under  Article  36  of  the  Constitution;  exercise  of \\npolitical rights under Article 38 of the Constitution and freedom of speech and debate in the \\nHouse under Article 117 of the Constitution.   \\nHon.  Members,  Article  108  of  the  Constitution  also  allows  a  coalition  to  elect  and \\n \\ndesignate their choice of the Leader of the Majority Party. The claim by the Kenya Kwanza \\nCoalition  is  based  under  this  limb.  Similarly,  the  Azimio  La  Umoja-One  Kenya  Coalition \\nPolitical  Party has staked its claim  to  the leadership  of the Majority  Party  in exercise of its \\nsecond skin as a coalition. \\n \\nWhat is clear from the Constitution is that the Leader of the Majority Party must lead \\neither a party or coalition of parties in the National Assembly, and not both. Indeed, as I noted \\nearlier  in  this  Communication,  in  determining  the  matter  confronting  the  House  today,  one \\nmust ask the question whether the entities claiming the leadership of the Majority Party are \\nparties or coalitions. The provision of the Constitution seems not to envisage the position of \\nthe Leader of the Majority Party being claimed by an entity that is both a party and a coalition \\nof parties. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The issue that arises at this stage is whether this conduct is in \\nconformity with the expectation of Article 108 of the Constitution, which requires an entity to \\nelect one of the two choices. \\nYou will recall that before the sine die adjournment of the 12th Parliament, the Standing \\n \\nOrders were amended to insert a new Standing Order 2B. This provision requires the Clerk of \\nthe  National  Assembly  to  obtain  a  certified  copy  of  any  coalition  agreement  entered  into \\nbetween two or more political parties. This amendment was necessitated by a dispute that arose \\nat the beginning of the 12th Parliament on the entitlement of the constituent parties of the then \\nNational  Super Alliance  Coalition, which is  commonly  referred to  as NASA Coalition, to a \\nshare in the membership of the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC). It was not possible \\nfor  the  then  Speaker  to  resolve  the  issue  without  access  to,  and  perusal  of  the  then  NASA \\nCoalition\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agreement that was deposited with the Registrar.  \\n \\nApart from resolving any disputes related to the membership of the PSC, it will interest \\nMembers to note that pursuant to Article 215(2) of the Constitution, part of the membership of \\nthe Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) is also drawn from nominees of the Majority \\nParty and Minority Parties in the House. This is the basis upon which the Standing Order was \\nintroduced in the last Parliament, so as to enable the Speaker to discern the undertakings made \\nby the parties with regard to the positions available to the House: the sharing of nominees for \\nappointment to Commissions such as the PSC and CRA, entitlement to positions in the East \\nAfrica Legislative Assembly (EALA) and, where necessary, determining the relative majorities \\nin the House. Journals of the House indicate that this provision was hardly intended to be used \\nto resolve questions of which party or coalition of parties has sufficient numbers in this House, \\nso as to be entitled to elect the Leader of the Majority Party.  \\n \\nHon. Members, the Political Parties Act provides a general framework for the formation \\nof coalitions, but leaves the substantive provisions to the formulation of the respective parties \\nto  a  coalition.  Where  the  substantive  provisions  of  a  coalition  agreement  are  unclear, \\nambiguous or are in contention, the interpretation of the intent of the parties is left to the general \\njurisdiction of the legal system. Nevertheless, perusal of an agreement entered into between the \\npartners  in  a  coalition  would  greatly  assist  in  resolving  or  forestalling  unnecessary  disputes \\nwhich are likely to impede the conduct of the business of the House. Indeed, upon obtaining a \\ncopy of the NASA Coalition Agreement, my immediate predecessor urged that the provision \\nof coalition agreements to the House should become standard practice. This is what informed \\nthe introduction of the new Standing Order 2B in our rules of procedure. \\nWith regard to the coalition agreements affecting the affairs of the 13th Parliament, the \\n \\nClerk wrote to the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties on 2nd September 2022. In her \\nletter  titled,  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRequests  for  Information  and  Copies  of  Coalition  Agreements  Pursuant  to  the \\nNational Assembly Standing Order 2B\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, she provided the Registrar with a list of parties with \\nrepresentation in the House at the time. The Clerk sought the following from the Registrar:  \\n \\narrangements. Please include the date of the registration of the coalition(s); \\n \\nare in place and the dates of the changes, if any; and, \\n \\nlisted herein. \\nHon. Members, in response, the Registrar noted that as at 21st  April 2022, Azimio La \\n \\nUmoja-One Kenya Coalition Party comprised 26 political parties namely: Jubilee Party (JP), \\nOrange Democratic Movement (ODM), Wiper Democratic Movement of Kenya (WDM-K), \\n\\n(ii) Information on changes made to any of the coalition agreements or partnerships that \\n\\n(i) Guidance on which particular political parties (from the list above) are in Coalition \\n\\n(iii) Certified copies of the coalition arrangements entered into by any of the parties \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

These are the members of the Coalition as at 3rd June 2022.  \\n\\nCan the Members take their seats? \\n \\n\\n(Several Members walked into the Chamber) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Members, the letter further notes that the Democratic Party, the National Agenda \\nParty of Kenya, the Grand Dream Development Party and Chama Cha Mashinani effectively \\nbecame members of the Coalition on 5th September 2022. The Registrar of Political Parties also \\nobserved that the National Ordinary People Empowerment Union (NOPEU) is not a member \\nof any of the coalitions. In the letter, the Registrar of Political  Parties also  conveys that the \\nMaendeleo  Chap  Chap  Party  (MCCM),  the  Pamoja  African  Alliance  (PAA),  the  United \\nDemocratic Movement (UDM) and the Movement for Democracy and Growth (MDG) have \\nfiled constitutional petitions and/or objections with regard to their membership of the Azimio \\nCoalition. \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nIt is notable that despite written requests by the Clerk of the National Assembly, the Registrar \\nof Political Parties did not convey certified copies of any pre-election or post-election coalition \\nagreements entered into by the parties with representation in this House in the response to the \\nletter dated 7th September 2022.  \\n\\nMay  I  at  this juncture report to  the House that surprisingly the Registrar of Political \\nParties today morning, at 8.30 a.m. submitted to me, through the Office of the Clerk, documents \\nsaid to be certified copies of the coalition agreements for the Kenya Kwanza Alliance Coalition \\nand the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition Party. Curiously, whereas the Registrar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter \\nto the Clerk of the National Assembly is dated 3rd October 2022, the accompanying agreements \\nbear  a  certification  of  the  following  day,  which  is 4th October  2022.  The  letter  and  the \\ndocuments  were  delivered  to  the  Office  of  the  Clerk today,  6th October  2022.  That  is  more \\nthan six weeks after the request by the Clerk. Seemingly, this may be read by any reasonable \\nperson to be a reaction to the proceedings of the House on Tuesday, 4th October 2022. \\n\\nNevertheless, I have had occasion to peruse the documents accompanying the letter as \\nagainst the documents tabled in the House on Tuesday this week. Despite attempting to advise \\nthe House on the status of the coalition agreements affecting the composition of the House as \\nat 3rd October 2022, the Registrar has again failed to mention the existence of any post-election \\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n6th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                   23 \\n\\n \\ncoalition  agreements.  This  is  a  glaring  omission  when  viewed  against  the  post-election \\ncoalition agreements tabled by the Member for Kikuyu Constituency during the proceedings. \\nThe post-election coalition agreements are critical to the Speaker for purposes of guaranteeing \\nconstitutional  rights  and  political  freedoms  of  Members  of  this  House  elected  under  UDM, \\nPAA, MCCP and MDG. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nThis  now  brings  me  to  the  submissions  made  by  Hon.  Opiyo  Wandayi  on  the \\nsignificance to be attached to the response of the Registrar of Political Parties, which he also \\ntabled  in  the  House  on  Tuesday  this  week  and  any  subsequent  communication  from  the \\nRegistrar.   It  will  be  recalled  that  the  distinguished  Member  for  Ugunja  submitted  that the \\nSpeaker  has  no  other  role  apart  from  conveying  information  contained  in  the  letter  by  the \\nRegistrar to the House. You will agree with me that this view is untenable for two main reasons. \\n Firstly, Section 10 of the Political Parties Act 2011 is clear that coalitions are not cast \\nin stone. They are evolving arrangements that can occur both prior to and after an election. The \\nRegistrar  has  shied  away  from  making  a  determination  on  the  post-election  status  of  the \\nexisting coalitions in light of the submissions made by part of the membership of this House \\nand  letters  written  to  me  by  a  number  of  Members  relating  to  post-election  coalitions.  The \\nSpeaker ought not to be a conduit for this indecision in so far as it has the potential of curtailing \\nthe business of the House that is an important constitutional arm of the national Government. \\nSecondly, you will also agree with me that the assertion by the Hon. Member for Ugunja is \\nflawed  on  account  of  the  history  I  have  given  to  the  House  relating  to  the  rationale  of \\nintroducing  Standing  Order  2B.  It  is,  indeed,  an  established  parliamentary  practice  that  the \\nSpeaker is not a mere conveyor belt of information. The Speaker must apply his mind to any \\ncommunication  or  document  before  it  is  presented  to  the  House  or  admitted  for  use  in  the \\nHouse. This  is  important in  order to  comply  with  the Standing  Orders of  this House and to \\nprotect the dignity of the House. \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nIn  the  present  instance,  Standing  Order  2B  expressly  requires  the  Clerk  to  obtain  a \\ncertified  copy  of  any  coalition  agreement  to  assist  the  Speaker  to  ascertain  the  relative \\nmajorities of the House and facilitate transaction business of the House. Certification of the \\ndocument and determination of its veracity and admissibility is of prime importance. You will \\nagree with me again that there would be chaos in this House if I made rulings on the basis of \\nan  unauthenticated,  unverifiable  and  inadmissible  document  that  affects  the  rights  of \\nMembers.  \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nI note that unless the Political Parties Act is amended or the House exercises its power \\nto  call  for  evidence  under  Article  125  of  the  Constitution, there  currently  exists  no  express \\nstatutory  obligation  to  the Registrar  to  furnish  the  House  with  coalition  agreements  as \\ncontemplated  under  Standing  Order  2B.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  12th Parliament  noted  this \\nparticular  gap  and  proposed  amendments  to  the  Political  Parties  Act  whose  introduction  I \\napproved in my Communication issued during the Afternoon Sitting of Tuesday, 4th October \\n2022. Those Members of Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) have a job to do to cure \\nthis lacuna. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

You will recall that I ruled the documents \\ntabled by Hon. Junet Mohamed as inadmissible owing to the inconsistencies that were apparent \\non  the  face  of  the  document.  The  inconsistencies  were  glaring,  especially  in  light  of  the \\nallegations made by Hon. David Ochieng denouncing association of both himself and his party \\nwith  the  Azimio  Coalition  Political  Party.  Apart  from  being  a  Member  of  this  House,  Hon. \\nDavid Ochieng is also the party leader of the MDG, an alleged party in the document tabled by \\nHon. Junet Mohamed. \\n\\nIn light of the objections raised by Hon. David Ochieng, the document became a centre \\nof particular focus with respect to its legality, validity and admissibility. The attempt by the \\nRegistrar  of  Political  Parties  to  convey  what  is  said  to  be  a  certified  copy  of  the  document \\ntabled  by  Hon.  Junet  Mohamed  on  6th October  2022  has  not  made  things  any  better.  The \\ndocument from the Registrar, just like the document tabled by Hon. Junet Mohamed, has the \\nsame glaring gaps and inconsistencies that make it inadmissible. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nMy predecessors have severally addressed the question of admissibility of Papers laid \\nin  this  House.  In  the  most  recent  case,  Hon.  Justin  Muturi  distilled  previous  guidance  on \\nadmissibility  of  documents  into  nine  brief  rules  in  a  Communication  issued  on  Tuesday, \\n10th May 2022 while ruling on the tabling of Papers by the then Member for Wajir County, \\nHon.  Fatuma  Gedi.  The  then  Speaker  ruled  that  in  assessing  the  admissibility  and/or \\nauthenticity or otherwise of a document tabled in the House, the Speaker  ought  to  examine \\nwhether the document:  \\n\\n(i) \\n(ii) \\n\\nrelates to the matter for which it has been tabled; \\nis signed, and if it is a Government document, by the authorised person or \\npersons; \\n\\n(iii)  bears the emblem or logo of the institution/person from which it originated \\n\\nor coat of arms in the case of documents from Government agencies; \\n\\n(iv)  clearly indicates the author and person to whom it is addressed; \\n(v)  discloses the origin or source of the document; \\n(vi)  bears certification where a document other than the original is being tabled; \\n(vii)  if electronic, has been obtained from a source that does not permit alteration \\n\\nof contents; \\n\\n(viii) is related to a claim made before the House or a Committee or its content \\n\\nhas a nexus with the claim; and \\nis stamped and clearly indicates the person signing off the stamp. \\n\\n(ix) \\n\\nCan the Hon. Members take their seats? \\n\\n(Several Members walked into the Chamber) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nHon.  Members,  a  perusal  of  the  document  tabled  by  Hon.  Junet  Mohamed  and  the \\nversion conveyed by the Registrar of Political Parties reveals glaring inconsistencies in both \\ndocuments. With regard to signatures, there is no uniformity in the manner in which the various \\npages of the documents have been signed off, or initialed. Some pages in the documents contain \\nfewer signatures than others while Page 3 of both documents, in particular, contain signatures \\nthat are hardly visible. The pagination of the two documents is also inconsistent. Pages 1 to 22 \\nbear page numbers; several pages with signatures bear no page numbers; and a paginated page \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I  am  inclined  to  think  that  these  are \\nsuperimpositions.  \\n\\nHon.  Members,  may  I  at  this  point  bring  to  the  attention  of  the  House  that  several \\nMembers said to belong to the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Party have formally \\nwritten to my office to denounce their association with the party. In a letter dated 9th September \\n2022  and  received  by  my  office  on  22nd  September  2022,  the  Member  for  Ugenya \\nConstituency,  Hon.  David  Ochieng  wrote  to  convey  the  decision  of  his  party,  the  MDG  to \\nterminate its membership with the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Party. In the letter, \\nHon. Ochieng also notes that his party is now a member of the Kenya Kwanza Coalition.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nIn letters received by my office on 21st and 22nd September 2022, Hon. Kenneth Charo, Hon. \\nGonzi  Rai  and Hon. Anthony Kenga, who were  all elected to  Parliament on the PAA Party \\nticket  formally  distanced  themselves  and  their  party  from  any  association  with  the  Azimio \\nCoalition.  The  three  categorically  noted  that  their  party  should  only  be  associated  with  the \\nKenya Kwanza Coalition with which it has entered into its only existing coalition agreement.  \\n \\n\\n \\nAdditionally, in a letter dated 16th September 2022 and received by my office on 19th September \\n2022, all the seven Members of Parliament elected to the National Assembly under the United \\nDemocratic  Movement  (UDM),  namely  Hon.  Maj  (Rtd).  Bashir  Abdullahi,  Hon.  Hassan \\nKulow, Hon. Haro Abdul Ebrahim, Hon. Mangale Chiforomodo, Hon. Yusuf Adan Haji, Hon. \\nJoseph Lekuton, Hon. Umul Kheir Kassim and Hon. Sulekha Harun distanced themselves and \\ntheir party from any alleged coalition agreement with the Azimio Coalition.  \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nInstead, they note in their letter that they are party to a post-election coalition agreement with \\nthe Kenya Kwanza Coalition. It is their contention that their affiliation with the Kenya Kwanza \\nCoalition has seemingly been ignored by the Registrar of Political Parties.  \\n\\nIt  will  be  recalled  that  during  the  debate  on  this  matter  on  Tuesday  this  week,  Hon. \\nDavid Ochieng; Hon. Kassait Kamket; Hon. Mwengi Mutuse; Hon. Bashir Abdullahi and Hon. \\nKenneth Charo also raised serious concerns as to the membership of the MDG; KANU; MCCP; \\nUDM and PAA in the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Party. At this stage, the question \\nthat comes to my mind as your Speaker is, what am I meant to do with these contentions?  \\n\\nAllegations were also made by a number of Members on alleged coercion and duress \\n\\nwhile entering into agreements with one of the coalitions.  \\n \\n\\n \\nOrder, Hon. Members! I have not finished what I am saying.  \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThis, if true, is a serious affront to the democratic rights and freedoms that we enjoy as \\ncitizens of this country. As a seasoned lawmaker and a lawyer, I note that the political freedoms \\ngranted to Kenyans by the Bill of Rights must be taken very seriously in the affairs of political \\nparties.  If  I were to  rely on the coalition agreements  tabled before this House,  I would find \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Our \\nConstitution is very Rights-centric. In any ruling I make as your Speaker, I must be guided by \\nthe  provisions  of  Article  3;  Article  10  and  Article  21  of  the  Constitution.  These  provisions \\nrequire me to uphold, respect and defend the Constitution whenever applying myself on any \\nquestions brought before me. I am also under an obligation to jealously protect the rights and \\nfreedoms guaranteed by the Constitution to all Members of this House and indeed all Kenyans. \\nYou  will  note that  even when  making  laws,  all  of  you  are  enjoined  under  Article  24  of  the \\nConstitution to ensure that any limits you place on a right or freedom are expressly stated and \\nthat the limitation is reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society.  \\n\\nHaving  looked  at  the  drafting  style  of  the  Political  Parties  Act,  vis-\\xc3\\xa0-vis  the \\nrequirements of Article 24(2) of the Constitution, it is evident that the Political Parties Act does \\nnot manifest or declare any intent whatsoever to limit the rights guaranteed under Article 36 of \\nthe Constitution on the freedom of association and Article 38 of the Constitution on political \\nrights. Political rights are not absolute. They may be limited in a manner that is consistent with \\nthe  provisions  of  Article  24  of  the  Constitution.  Indeed,  the  Political  Parties  Act  does  not \\nengage in  the substantive limitation  of rights  but only deals  with  the procedural  exercise of \\nthose rights in terms of timelines. Indeed, the architecture of the Act is that timelines are only \\nprescribed with respect to activities that fall before the election date which seem to be related \\nto  the  management  of  the  election  calendar.  There  are  no  timelines  prescribed  for  activities \\nafter the election date. From the provisions of the Act, it appears that a person is at liberty to \\njoin and leave political parties as long as they notify the Registrar of their actions.  \\n\\nI am not sure whether a provision of a coalition agreement regulating the period within \\nwhich a Member may exit a coalition would pass the test of being compliant with the Political \\nParties Act, in the first instance, or the Constitution, in the second instance.  Fortunately, that \\nis not for me to decide. I trust those who are aggrieved will find their way to courts of law in \\nexercise of their powers under Article 165 of the Constitution. Noting that some of the matters \\nraised were said to be pending either in the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal or the court, I \\nshall refrain from pronouncing myself on such. \\n\\nHon. Members, let me now turn to the nexus between the letter from the Registrar of \\nPolitical  Parties  and  the  several  gazette  notices  published  by  the  Independent  Electoral  and \\nBoundaries Commission (IEBC) with respect to your election or nomination as Members of \\nthis House. Based on Gazette Notices No. 9950 and 9951 of 2022 both dated 23rd August 2022; \\nGazette Notice No. 10535 of 2022 dated 5th September 2022; Gazette  Notice No. 10537 of \\n2022 dated 7th September 2022 and Gazette Notice No. 10710 of 2022 dated 9th September \\n2022  the  current  composition  of  the  National  Assembly  by  individual  political  parties  is  as \\nfollows: The UDA), 145; ODM, 86; Jubilee Party, 28; WDM, 26; UDM, 8; ANC, 8; FORD-\\nK, 6; KANU, 6; DAP-K, 5; PAA, 3; KUP, 3; UPIA 2; MCCP, 2; TSP, 2; UPA, 1; NAP-K, 1; \\nNOPEU, 1; GDDP, 1; DP, 1; MDG)1; and CCM, 1. \\n\\nHon. Members, reference to the letter by the Registrar of Political Parties would give \\nthe cumulative number of members of the constituent parties of what the Registrar refers to \\nas the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition Party as 171 Members against 165 Members \\nof the constituent parties of what the Registrar refers to as the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. It is \\nhowever,  notable  that  a  total  of  14  Members  are  drawn  from  four  parties  which  is  UDM, \\nMDG, MCCP and PAA who according to the letter of the Registrar have filed constitutional \\npetitions and objections against their membership in Azimio. This implies that the letter from \\nthe Registrar may not be used to compute the membership of the Majority and Minority parties \\nby dint of the admission contained in it on the existing constitutional petitions and objections. \\nHon.

Order, Members. If you listen\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n \\n\\n \\nHon. Mbadi, I am sure you know the difference between if and when. Consequently, \\nthe Azimio Coalition would then comprise a total of 157 Members. However, the pending \\nconstitutional cases and objections by Members of UDM, MDG, MCCP and PAA noted by \\nthe  Registrar  of  Political  Parties,  in  addition  to  the  letters  sent  by  the  Members  and  the \\ncontentions recorded during Tuesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sitting have a profound bearing on the matter at hand \\nin so far as the same relates to the business of the House. \\n\\nAt  this  stage,  the  House  has  a  choice  to  either  halt  its  proceedings  and  await  the \\ndetermination of matters that are before the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal and the courts \\nor to permit the Speaker to make a decision that facilitates this House to continue discharging \\nits constitutional functions. \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOrder! You will hear the Speaker in silence. In any event, Members are aware that the \\nsub judice rule is a rule that the House imposes on itself. It can never be contemplated that \\nthe House can curtail the performance of its own mandate.  \\n \\n\\nCan the Hon. Members at the Bar take their seats?  \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n (Several Members walked into the Chamber) \\n\\nHon. Member, take your seats. This includes among others, the formation of not only \\nthe  House  Business  Committee,  but  also  other  key  Committees  of  the  House  whose \\nmembership must be appointed within a prescribed timeline of seven days and others that are \\nextremely critical to the functioning of this House and the national Government. \\n\\nThe Committees that ought to be constituted within seven days include the following: \\n1.  The House Business Committee which determines, prioritises and approves \\n\\nthe business to be considered by this House under Standing Order No.171; \\n\\n2.  The Committee on Selection which is responsible for nominating Members \\n\\nto serve in Committees under Standing Order 172; \\n\\n3.  The Committee on Appointments which is responsible for vetting of persons \\nnominated  to  serve  as  Cabinet  Secretaries  under  Article  152(2)  of  the \\nConstitution; \\n\\n4.  The  Budget  and  Appropriations  Committee  which  is  responsible  for \\n\\nconsideration of the Budget Estimates; and \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The  National  Government  Constituencies  Development  Fund  Committee \\nwhich  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  policy  and  legislative  framework \\nmatters relating to the NG-CDF. This is especially important noting the need \\nfor a forum to deliberate some current matters that you are all fully aware of. \\nHon. Members, the disclosure by the Registrar relating to the petitions and objections, \\nthe letters by the Members of the four parties, the oral objections raised in this House, and the \\nneed to promote the continuity of the business of the House while respecting the due process \\nof  the  courts  of  law,  presents  this  House  with  a  complex  situation  that  requires  balanced \\nconsideration of the intent and philosophy behind the provisions of Articles 108 and 124 of the \\nConstitution. \\n\\n In  determining  this  delicate  balance  between  the  provision  that  establishes  the \\nleadership positions of the House, and the provision which empowers this House to make its \\nown rules of procedure, due regard must be given to Article 3 of the Constitution which requires \\nall persons to protect, defend and uphold the Constitution and Article 10 of the Constitution \\nwhich requires one to apply the national values and principles of governance when interpreting \\nthe Constitution. \\n\\nHon. Members, I note that the four parties which I mentioned cumulatively, comprise \\nof 14 Members. The Members elected to this House under the four parties have exercised their \\nfreedom of association under Article 36 of the Constitution. They have already migrated to the \\nKenya Kwanza Alliance both in writing and in action. The parties are already enjoying benefits \\naccruing  from  their  membership  of  the  Kenya  Kwanza  Coalition  based  on  the  coalition \\nagreements that they signed and deposited with the Registrar. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n Indeed, and as noted earlier, the 14 Members have written to me distancing themselves and \\ntheir parties from the Azimio Coalition and have called upon Hon. Speaker to recognise their \\ncoalition agreement with Kenya Kwanza with respect to the business of this House. I also noted \\nthe verbal representation made by some of the 14 Members during the debate on this matter on \\nTuesday, 4th October 2022. \\n\\n Hon. Members, I started by noting the sentiments by Hon. John Mbadi on the fact that \\nthe  Members  comprising  the  leadership  of  the  Kenya  Kwanza  Coalition  and  the  Azimio  la \\nUmoja-One  Kenya  Coalition  Party  was  not  in  contention.  Indeed,  no  objection  was  raised \\nduring the debate on the issue of either proposing an alternate line up or the allusion to the \\nexistence of any other coalition comprising any parties with representation in this House. \\n\\nHaving addressed the question of who between the Kenya Kwanza Coalition and the \\nAzimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition is entitled to appoint the Leader of the Majority Party, \\nallow me to discharge my responsibilities under Standing Order 19A(4) and 20(4) with respect \\nto the leadership of the House in the 13th Parliament. \\n\\nHon. Members allow me now to address the House on the fate of the letters received \\nfrom Hon. Jeremiah Kioni, the Secretary General of the Jubilee Party, which I mentioned in \\nmy Communication on Tuesday, 4th October, 2022. The Jubilee Party, and indeed, any other \\nparliamentary party is at liberty to designate its party leaders and whips by dint of the provisions \\nof  Standing  Order  20A  which  provides  for  the  recognition  of  parliamentary  parties. \\nSpecifically, the Standing Order provides that a parliamentary party has the right to designate \\na leader and Whip of the party in the House for purposes of the transaction of the business of \\nthe  House.  However,  in  parliamentary  practice,  the  House  frowns  upon  any  purported \\ncommunication emanating from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrangers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d especially if the matter relates to the internal \\norganization of sections within the House. This is intended to ensure that the House only \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

For \\nclarity, Standing Order 20A (3) provides, and I quote: \\n\\n3.  The  names  of  the  Members  designated  as  party  whips  shall  be \\n\\ncommunicated to the Speaker in writing by: \\n\\na)  the Leader of the Majority Party on behalf of the Majority Party; \\nb)  the Leader of the Minority Party on behalf of the Minority Party; \\n\\nor \\n\\nc)  the leader of a parliamentary party in the National Assembly in \\ncase of a parliamentary party that is not part of a coalition forming \\nthe Majority Party or the Minority Party.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nIn  order  to  facilitate  the  transaction  of  the  business  of  the  House  the  Leader  of  the \\nMajority Party and the Leader of the Minority Party are required to forward to me the names \\nof Members who shall sit in the five critical committees that I mentioned earlier. \\n\\nHon.  Members,  Standing  Order  171(1)(f)  provides  that,  apart  from  the  House \\nleadership, the House Business Committee consists of nine other Members nominated by the \\nparliamentary  parties,  reflecting  the  relative  majorities  and  taking  into  consideration  the \\ninterests of parties other than parliamentary parties and independents. \\n \\nFurthermore, Standing Order 172(1)(c) provides that besides the House leadership, the \\nCommittee on Selection consists of not less than 11 and not more than 21 Members nominated \\nby the parliamentary parties reflecting the relative majorities and taking into consideration the \\ninterests of parties other than parliamentary parties and independents. \\n\\nStanding Order 204(1) provides that apart from the leadership of the House, Committee \\non  Appointments  consists  of  not  more  than  15  other  Members  nominated  by  the  House \\nBusiness Committee on the basis of proportional party membership taking into consideration \\nthe numerical strength of the parties and interests of independents. \\n\\nHon. Members, upon formation of the Committee on Selection, I will be asking the \\nparty  leadership  to  nominate  Members  for  appointment  to  the  rest  of  the  committees  with \\nparticular priority to the Budget and Appropriations Committee and the National Government \\nConstituency Development Fund Committee. It is imperative that in nominating the Members \\nto  the  Committees,  Majority  and  Minority  Leaders  should  as  much  as  possible  take  into \\nconsideration  the  gender  representation,  the  need  for  regional  balance  and  the  interests  of \\nparties other than parliamentary parties and indeed the Independents. \\n\\nAs to the completeness of the membership of the aforementioned committees, you \\nwill note that I have reserved some slots for Independent Members in each of the three \\nCommittees  whose  nomination  ratios  I  have  specified.  This  is  to  ensure  adherence  to  the \\nStanding Orders which require the recognition of the various shades of opinion represented \\nin the House. As my predecessor noted during the 12th Parliament, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Speaker should protect \\nthe  Independent  Members  and  small  parties  in  the  nomination  to  and  discharge  from \\ncommittees.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nHon. Members in summary therefore, my considered determination on the matter \\n\\nraised is as follows: \\n\\n1.  THAT, consideration of the various allegations of coercion and duress at the time \\nof entering into coalition agreements and any appropriate remedy for the same lies \\noutside the authority of this House. \\n\\n2.  THAT, in my considered opinion, it would be imprudent to treat the 14 Members \\nelected to the House under the UDM, PAA, MCCP and MDG as part of a coalition \\nthat  they  have  expressly  distanced  both  themselves  and  their  parties  from.  I  am \\ntherefore persuaded that the 14 Members and their parties are part  of the Kenya \\nKwanza Coalition. This, in my view, would be fair and in accordance with previous \\nrulings by my predecessors on related matters. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The House would be at a standstill \\nwithout a clear guidance on the leadership of the House. It is so directed. \\n\\nWe now go back to the debate on the Presidential Address.  \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja, ODM): On a point of order, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Yes, Hon. Wandayi. \\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja, ODM): Hon. Speaker, I listened keenly to your ruling \\non  this  contentious  issue.  Whereas,  of  course,  I  do  not  agree  with  it,  I  would  wish  to \\nacknowledge the fact  that this House operates in  a quasi-judicial manner.  Therefore, in  line \\nwith rules of natural justice, tenets of democracy and established jurisprudence, I would wish \\nto give notice that we shall be moving you to review your decision. For that reason, I will be \\nasking you to give me an opportunity to make certain submissions or to make an application \\nfor  you  to  review  your  decision.  My  application  is,  obviously,  in  line  with  established \\njurisprudential practice. Again, I will be asking you to direct the Clerk to facilitate my coalition \\nwith certified copies of your ruling, if possible by close of business today. \\n \\nHon. Speaker, I say this with tremendous respect to your office and to the institution of \\nParliament.  It  is  important  for  us  to  establish  a  culture  of  openness  and  transparency  and, \\nindeed, to work consciously towards entrenching democracy and the rule of law. So, I will be \\nasking you to allow me to formally make that application at the earliest possible opportunity. I \\nam seeking leave. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Order, Hon. Members. In the tradition of the House, under our Standing \\nOrders and practice, once the Speaker makes a ruling such as the one I have made, it is not \\nsubject to debate, it is not appealable and it stands as it is. I want to take this opportunity to \\nsalute and thank you, Hon. Wandayi and all Members of the House, for the decorum that you \\nhave exhibited throughout the close to one hour that I delivered the ruling. \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Let the chips fall \\nwhere  they  may.  Take  up  your  offices.  Carry  out  a  robust  and  vibrant  oversight  of  the \\nGovernment and make sure that public resources from taxpayers are put to good use. Audit \\ntheir use vigorously and make sure that you do everything possible within the law to ensure \\nthat we have  a responsible Parliament, with both  sides being responsive to  the needs of the \\npeople of Kenya. \\n\\nThere will be no further debate on this matter. You know the rules. You are all very \\nsenior Members. And the new colleagues who have come in want to learn from you. Do not \\ngive them misdirection on procedure. I now want us to go to the Order that we had suspended \\nto take the ruling. I will give the Floor to Hon. Abdikadir Mohamed of Lagdera.  \\n \\n\\n(Several Members rose in their places) \\n\\nOn the same matter?  \\nHon. Members: Yes. \\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\nHon. Speaker: Order, Hon.

You can \\nget it in the course of the evening or tomorrow, depending on what the Clerks-at-the-Table will \\ndo, and you can analyse it and critique it. You can do many things about it except debate it on \\nthe Floor of this House.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nI  indulged  the  distinguished  Member  for  Ugunja,  being  your  leader,  to  make  a \\ncomment, which he did and we have taken it in the stride. I have given him direction and you \\ncan see how distinguished he is with respect to what I have said. I want to urge you to remember \\nthat we have  called out  the order which we suspended before the ruling.  If the Member  for \\nLagdera is on the Floor, he can continue with debate. If he is not, we can give the Floor to the \\nnext Member.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Members: He is here. \\nHon. Speaker: Go on, Member. \\nHon. Abdikadir Mohamed (Lagdera, ODM): Thank you, Hon.

Speaker, Members will note that in constituting this House Business Committee \\n(HBC),  which  is  slightly  over  a  week  or  almost  two  weeks  late,  we  have  tried  to  achieve \\nregional, ethnic and gender balance and representation in line with our Standing Orders. We \\nhave  considered  small  parties  that  do  not  constitute  parliamentary  political  parties  but  are \\nrepresented  in  the  House.  You  will  note  that  we  have  Members  who  represent  these  small \\nparties from both sides of the political divide. We also have Members from both coalitions that \\nrepresent the main partner-parties. More importantly, you realise that we have a strong team of \\n12  Independent  Members,  and  they  are  also  represented  in  the  House  Business  Committee \\n(HBC) by Hon. Joshua Mbithi Mwalyo.  \\n\\nI  urge  Members  to  support  the  formation  of  this  Committee  because  as  you  are  all \\naware,  we  cannot  transact  any  business  without  the  constitution  of  the  HBC.  This  is  the \\nCommittee  that  will  help  us  to  form  the  Committee  on  Selection  and  the  Committee  on \\nAppointments, and even confirm our Calendar, which without pre-empting debate, is in line \\nfor the course of the day tomorrow. I do not want to say much in relation to this, because all of \\nus know the importance of this Committee. It is regrettable that because of some small issues \\nthat we had in the last week or so, we were not able to constitute this Committee and are late. \\nIn actual fact, we ought to have set up this Committee within seven days. It ought to have come \\non  Thursday  last  week,  but  because  of  the  extraordinary  circumstances,  we  had  to  delay  to \\ntoday. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

We have endeavoured \\nto pick both new Members who are coming into the House for the first time, and very seasoned \\nMembers  of  the  House,  who  are  very  experienced  in  the  HBC  and  affairs  of  the  House, \\nincluding the House Leadership. I think it is a very well-balanced Committee representing the \\nindependents, the veterans, new Members and even those who represent parties smaller than \\nthe parliamentary political parties that we have. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, with that, I beg for everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s support. I ask my brother and colleague, \\n\\nthe Leader of the Minority Party, Hon. Opiyo Wandayi, to second. \\n\\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. I wish to second the \\nMotion that is before the House on the constitution of the HBC in line with the requirements \\nof  Standing  Order  171.  To  echo  what  Hon.  Kimani  Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah  has  said,  there  is  no  doubt \\nwhatsoever that Hon. Members who have been placed on this important Committee qualify. In \\nmy view, they are more than equal to the task that lies ahead. This is an extremely important \\nCommittee in the operations of the House. I urge my colleagues to approve the list. \\n\\nOnce the Committee is constituted, I would like it to go out fully and embark on its \\nmandate. One of the biggest tasks that lie ahead is to ensure that business that is prioritised to \\ncome before the House is business that advances the interests of the public. This Committee \\nshould ensure that this House engages in matters that are of importance to the nation. It is on \\nrecord that from as far back as the 11th Parliament, there are reports which have continued to \\nlie on the shelves of this House\\xe2\\x80\\x94reports which should have found their way to the Floor of \\nthis House for deliberation and eventual determination one way or the other by the House. Such \\nreports are still lying idle on the shelves of Parliament. Once constituted, I urge the Committee \\nto take it upon itself to prioritise such business. I will not go into details of those reports. If I \\ndo so, I will be opening a can of worms. Hon. Duale, I am sure you know what I mean by that. \\nThis Committee has its work cut out. I also hope that once this Committee embarks on \\nits work, it will adopt a bipartisan approach to issues and prioritise issues that are of interest to \\nthe country. That is the only way this Parliament can move forward and execute its mandate. \\nCurrently, the country is facing myriad challenges. The cost of basic commodities is getting \\nout  of  reach  for  the  common  man.  Food  prices  specifically  are  out  of  this  world.  That  is \\nsomething that needs to be prioritised by this Committee so that the House can deal with it for \\nthe country to go back to where it should be. The country is facing serious insecurity issues. \\nKenyans are being butchered day in, day out like wild animals. We need to address the issue \\nof insecurity in the country. It is an issue that needs to be prioritised by this Committee. Going \\nforward, we should make it a  rule rather than the exception that whatever  goes through the \\nHBC  and  ends  up  on  the  Floor  of  this  House  is  only  that  which  advances  the  cause  of  the \\ncountry, and not one that advances parochial interests.  \\n\\nThis country is now past the campaign period. We expect everyone in the Legislature \\nand the Executive to get down to work. Everybody should do their work. We expect those in \\nthe Executive to leave campaign hangovers behind them and focus on that which advances the \\ncause of the country. Likewise, this House should now operate beyond the campaigns and deal \\nwith issues that are of utmost importance; issues that unite us rather than those that divide us. \\nThis is a committee that will be very instrumental in those endeavours. \\n\\nWithout saying too much, I second and urge my colleagues to approve the list. \\nThank you.  \\nHon. Speaker: Order, Hon. Members. Order.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\nHon. Members: Put the question. \\nHon. Speaker: Is that the mood of the House? \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Members: Yes. \\n\\n(Question put and agreed to) \\n\\n \\n \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Members, that now brings the House to a level where we can start \\nprocessing and transacting business. I direct that the Members who have been approved by the \\nHouse as Members of this Committee leave the House immediately and go to Committee Room \\n9 for HBC meeting. The Deputy Speaker will continue presiding over the debate at Order No. \\n9, this being the last allotted day of debate on the Presidential speech. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Members. \\nHon. Samwel Chepkonga (Ainabkoi, UDA): On a point of order, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Yes, Hon. Chepkonga. What is your point of order? \\n \\n \\nHon. Samwel Chepkonga (Ainabkoi, UDA): Hon. Speaker, I rise pursuant to Standing \\nOrder 259D. As you know, we lost a former Member of Parliament (MP), and I wanted to make \\na statement on his passing on. If you allow me, I would like to read the statement. It would be \\nan honour to do that. \\n \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Go ahead.  \\nOrder, Hon. Members. Let us hear Hon. Chepkonga in silence. \\n\\nDEMISE OF HON. WILLIAM CHEPKUT \\n\\n \\n \\nHon. Samwel Chepkonga (Ainabkoi, UDA): Hon. Speaker, it is with profound sorrow \\nthat I wish to make a statement regarding the untimely passing on of the former Member of \\nParliament MP for Ainabkoi Constituency on the morning of Saturday, 8th October 2022, while \\nbeing  rushed  for  treatment  at  Mediheal  Hospital,  Nairobi.  Hon.  Chepkut  was  born  on  31st \\nDecember 1970. He attended Flax Primary School and various universities before attaining his \\nMaster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree from Kenyatta University in Community Development and Organisation. He \\ndeclared his interest to vie for the parliamentary seat of Ainabkoi Constituency in 2017. During \\nnominations,  he  sought  the  seat  under  the  Jubilee  Party  ticket.  He  won  elections  as  an \\nindependent Member of Parliament in the elections that were held in 2017.  \\n\\nHon.  Speaker,  for  the  record,  he  defeated  this  Member  who  is  now  reading  the \\n\\nStatement. Nonetheless, as an MP, he sponsored a number of Bills, including: \\n\\n1.  The Coffee Bill (Senate Bill No. 22 of 2020); \\n2.  The Natural Resources Benefit Sharing Bill (Senate Bill No. 25 of 2020); \\n3.  The Health (Amendment) Bill (Senate Bill No. 26 of 2020); \\n4.  The Basic Education (Amendment) Bill (Senate Bill No. 4 of 2021); \\n5.  The Kenya Sign Language Bill (Senate Bill No. 5 of 2011); and,  \\n6.  The County Vocational Education and Training Bill (Senate Bill No. 6 of \\n\\n2021). \\n\\nApart from being an MP, he was also the Vice-Chairman of the Special Funds Accounts \\n\\nCommittee and the Committee on Appointments. \\n\\nHe had a senior position at the Office of the President between 1997 to 2003. He also \\nworked as the long serving personal assistant and private secretary of the Late Hon. Nicholas \\nBiwott, who was a very powerful Minister during the Kenya African National Union (KANU) \\nera. On behalf of the great people of Ainabkoi Constituency and indeed on my behalf, I wish \\nto  convey  our  sincere  condolences  to  his  family,  friends  and  the  people  of  the  larger  Uasin \\nGishu County for this great loss. \\n\\nHon.  Speaker,  with  your  indulgence,  I  request  that  you  allow  that  we  all  stand  to \\nobserve a minute of silence in honour of the late Hon. William Chirchir Chepkut. Fare thee \\nwell, Hon. Chepkut. May his soul rest in eternal peace. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Thank you.  \\nOrder, Hon. Members. In honour of our departed colleague and friend, I order that we \\n\\nstand and observe a minute of silence.\\n\\n(Hon.

Johana Kipyegon (Emurua Dikirr, UDA): On a point of order, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Yes, Hon. Ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99eno. \\nHon. Johana Kipyegon (Emurua Dikirr, UDA): Hon. Speaker, thank you. With your \\n\\n \\nindulgence, you should allow Members to convey their condolences. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: We have already moved to the next Order. You showed no indication \\n\\nthat you wanted to say anything. \\n\\n \\nHon. Johana Kipyegon (Emurua Dikirr, UDA): Hon. Speaker, I was already on a point \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\nof order. \\n\\nHon.  Speaker:  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker  will  give  you  15  minutes  to  make  brief \\ncomments.  Remember  that  we  have  a  scheduled  matter  that  should  be  debated  without \\ninterruption.  However,  this  is  an  extraordinary  matter.  I  will  allow  15  minutes  of  three \\nMembers from each side to make comments and eulogise our departed friend. \\n\\n[The Speaker (Hon.

Aden Duale (Garissa Township, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. On \\n \\nbehalf of the people of Garissa Township and on my behalf, let me send my condolences to the \\nfamily and friends of the former MP for Ainabkoi, the late Hon. Chepkut.  \\n\\nHe was with us in the 12th Parliament, and we will remember him as a very humorous \\nman. I am sure that the person who will miss him most is the former President, Uhuru Kenyatta. \\nThere was no one time that Hon. Chepkut would get an opportunity on the Floor of the House \\nand fail to remember the then Commander-in-Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF). He \\nused  to  call  him  a  five-star  General.  This  man  whom  we  remember  today  has  a  very  long \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

This is another total man. He worked with Hon. Nicholas Biwott for many years. As \\nwe bury him next Tuesday, he will go down with a lot of experience.  \\nHe was a man who could make a call, if you wanted to speak to the late Mzee Moi. He \\n \\nasked me one day whether I wanted to speak to him. I thought that he was joking. He called \\nand in one second, Mzee Moi was on the line. That is how powerful Hon. Chepkut was. I am \\nsure that he is among the many other great leaders whom we have lost in this House. Let me \\nask all Members, in good faith, through Hon. Chepkonga, to contribute. We should attend his \\nburial on Tuesday next week in his remembrance and the people whom he represented. \\n \\n \\nSorry, it is Hon. Chepkut. I apologise.  \\n \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, those who want to eulogise Hon. Chepkonga\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThe Members who want to eulogise Hon. Chepkut should press the intervention button \\nso that we do not interfere with debate time. We will now have Hon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah, who \\nis the Leader of the Majority Party. \\n\\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. Before \\nwe retreat to  attend the HBC, let me also take this opportunity  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 on behalf of the people of \\nKikuyu  and  many  other  Kenyans  who  knew  the  Late  Hon.  Chepkut  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  to  convey  our  very \\nheartfelt condolences to his immediate family and the people of Ainabkoi Constituency. \\n\\nAs the ranking Member, Hon. Aden Duale has said that Hon. Chepkut had his usual \\nseat on the front bench here, just right where Hon. (Dr.) Mutunga is seated. We all remember \\nhim  for  his  humour.  Every  time  he  stood  up  to  speak  in  this  Chamber,  he  referred  to  his \\nExcellency the President as the Commander-in-Chief of KDF and a five-star General. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\nMany of us found humour in his speech. He was, indeed, a very amiable person with everybody \\nacross the political divide. I do not think that there is anybody who worked with Hon. Chepkut \\nin the last Parliament who would say that he ever stepped on his toes in any way. He was a \\nvery amiable person. He was a likeable character, and a seasoned civil servant who served not \\nonly as a District Officer in the early KANU days, but also as a personal assistant of the late \\nHon. Biwott. \\n\\nWith those few remarks Hon. Deputy Speaker, let us all pray for his family and his soul \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Hon.  Members,  I  will  give  this  chance  to  the  Member  for \\n\\nto rest in eternal peace. Thank you. \\n \\nMbeere North. \\nHon.  Ruku  GK  (Mbeere  North,  DP):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker  for  this \\n \\nopportunity to address the House for the first time. I tried to become the MP for Mbeere North \\nin 2013 and 2017, but failed. So for me, this is a dream come true. I am grateful and humbled \\nby the trust that the people of Mbeere have bestowed upon me. I undertake to serve those who \\nvoted for me and those who did not vote for me in equal measure. I am alive to the functions \\nof the House.  \\n \\nspeech while you should focus on eulogising the Hon. Chepkut. \\n  \\nHouse. Namely to represent the electorate, to legislate and to oversee the Executive.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Hon.  Member  for  Mbeere,  you  are  going  into  your  maiden \\n\\nHon.

Deputy Speaker: Hon. Member, maybe you can leave the rest of your time and \\ncome back to make your maiden speech hereafter. So, we can now move on to the Member for \\nEmgwen. \\n \\nHon. Josses Lelmengit (Emgwen, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for this \\nopportunity. On behalf of Emgwenians and myself, I pass my message of condolence for the \\nloss of a former Member of this House, Hon. Chepkut. I ask every Member in this House to \\ngive the support the family may need. Let us generously give so that we give Chepkut a decent \\nsend off. \\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Member for Mwingi Central. \\n \\nHon. Gideon Mulyungi (Mwingi Central, WDM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, \\n \\nfor  giving  me  this  opportunity  to  eulogise  our  colleague  and  friend,  the  late  Hon.  William \\nChepkut, the former MP for Ainabkoi. \\n\\nI recall the late as a very humorous person. He was the smartest person in this House\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nalways in a three-piece suit and very humorous. Therefore, on my behalf, my family and the \\npeople of Mwingi Central, I condole the family of the late, and the constituency for the loss of \\nthis humorous and very good person. \\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: The Hon. Member for Kimilili. \\n \\n \\nHon. Didmus Barasa (Kimilili, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving \\nme this opportunity to eulogise my friend, the former Member for Ainabkoi Constituency. We \\nwill remember Hon. Chepkut as a very generous man. He was willing to share the little he had \\nwith the disadvantaged. We will also remember him as a hands-on person. This Member would \\ncall even a government officer responsible and put him or her on speaker when there was a \\nmatter affecting his electorate. He was very hands-on. Even with his passing on, we celebrate \\nhis life. There are many things that we must learn from the Hon. Chepkut. May the almighty \\nGod  rest  his  soul  in  eternal  peace  and  continue  to  stand  with  the  people  of  Ainabkoi \\nConstituency. \\n \\n \\nMember for Seme. \\nHon. (Dr) James Nyikal (Seme, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving \\n \\nme an opportunity to eulogise our colleague. On behalf of the people of Seme and myself, I \\ntake this opportunity to pass my sincere condolences to his family and his constituency. \\n\\nThank you. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: I think time for eulogies is up. We have four more minutes, \\n\\nThough  hilarious  and  humorous,  this  was  an  extremely  serious  man.  I  know  that \\nbecause we worked with him when I was in the Executive. Behind all that humour, he was a \\nserious, hard working person. I also appreciate that regardless of how tense things were in this \\nHouse  or  how  much  we  differed,  everybody  listened  when  he  took  to  the  Floor.  With  his \\nhumour, he put everybody at peace and, in a way, managed to pass his message. He did this \\nvery diligently and in support and service of the people that elected him.   \\nLet the almighty God rest his soul in eternal peace. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Kabuchai. \\n \\n \\nHon. Majimbo Kalasinga (Kabuchai, FORD): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for \\nallowing  me  to  eulogise  my  good  friend.  I  observed  that  he  never  missed  the  word  \\xe2\\x80\\x98sir\\xe2\\x80\\x99  or \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 throughout his life, whenever he was on phone or addressing anybody. This is a man \\nwho gave respect to anybody he ever called. I join the House in eulogising our good friend who \\nhas left us.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, you are not wrong because when you talked of Chepkonga, the \\n\\nname is almost the same with that of the area MP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  \\n \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.

Deputy Speaker: Member for Vihiga County. \\n \\n \\nHon. Adagala Beatrice (Vihiga County, ANC): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I \\ntake this opportunity to pass our condolences, as the people of Vihiga County, to the family of \\nthe late William, who was a Member for Ainabkoi. He used to sit with us here and make us \\nlaugh.  He  was  very  humorous.  Wherever  you  met  him,  he  was  always  laughing.  As  a \\nParliament, we are going to miss his humorous way of talking. He never segregated people. He \\nused to laugh with everybody. We condole with the family and ask God to give them strength \\nat this trying moment as they mourn their departed father, brother and uncle.  \\n\\nMay his soul rest in eternal peace.  \\n \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  We  can  now  revert  to  the  Motion  on  the  remarks  on  the \\nPresident\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  speech.  We  will  pick  from  where  we  stopped.  I  do  not  have  the  name  of  the \\nconstituency, but it is the Hon. Abdikadir Mohammed who was interrupted last time.  You may \\nproceed. \\n\\nHon.  Abdikadir  Mohamed  (Lagdera,  ODM):  Thank  you  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker  for \\ngiving me this opportunity to contribute to the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech. First,  I wish to thank my \\nconstituents of Lagdera for electing me to represent them in the 13th Parliament.   \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I also wish to congratulate you for having been elected to be the \\n\\nDeputy Speaker of this House.   \\n\\nThe President spoke, in paragraph 48, of the ongoing drought in Northern Kenya and \\nthe entire country, saying that climate change was the cause.  He said that the Government is \\ngoing to distribute relief food. The President did not give this matter the seriousness it needs.  \\nIn Northern Kenya, already animals and people are dying. We do not want relief food only; we \\nneed other interventions.  For example, the dying animals need feeds.  The Government should \\nalso distribute animal feeds; and do water trucking.  We need many other things so as to protect \\nthe livelihoods of these people.   \\n\\nWhile  speaking  on  Universal  Health  Care  (UHC),  the  president  said  that  he  will \\nrestructure National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). The NHIF has been over-restructured.  I \\nwas an employee of the NHIF for the last 10 years; it has been over-restructured.  It does not \\nneed to be restructured again.  As it is now, it can handle the issues of the UHC.   \\n\\nThere is also the problem of insecurity in Northern Kenya.  Whenever there is a drought, \\npastoralist  always  clash  because  of  pasture.  So,  the  Government  should  also  address  this \\nparticular issue this time when there is drought in Northern Kenya.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I wish to thank you for giving me this opportunity.  That is all. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker:  Thank you. The Member has donated more time for the next \\n\\nMembers, and I hope that everyone can do that.   \\nIt is now time for MP for Mbeere North. \\nHon. Ruku GK (Mbeere North, DP):  Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you for giving me \\nthis opportunity to address the House for the first time.  I tried to be Member for Mbeere North \\nin 2013 and 2017, but failed.  So, for me, this is a dream come true; and it is for this reason that \\nI am grateful and humbled by the trust that the people for Mbeere North have bestowed upon \\nme.  I intend to serve both those who voted and those who did not vote for me.   \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I am a live to the functions of the House, namely to represent the \\nelectorate, legislate and oversight the Executive.  I am happy that in the inaugural address to \\nthis  House,  the  President  was  emphatic  that  he  expects  legislation  and  oversight  from  the \\nHouse.  \\n\\nTo achieve the purpose of the House, and in order to serve the aspirations of the country, \\nI would urge that we work together, and look at the Bills and Motions that come before us for \\nconsideration and approval.  I say so because there is no Kenya Kwanza Alliance country and \\nan Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Alliance country. The effect of bad laws from the House or \\nno laws coming out of this House will be felt in the entire country.    \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I will, therefore, urge that \\nthe drafters in the House are efficient to ensure speedy drafting of Bills.  I also propose that the \\ndrafters to be around to invite sectoral experts in order to enrich and ensure quality Bills.   \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  as  a  House,  we  need  to  vacate  from  criminalisation  of \\nadministrative functions and processes.  I say so because in the recent past, public officers have \\nbecome overly ineffective as a result of criminalisation of every process in their professional \\nfunctions.  As  a  result,  the  Directorate  of  Criminal  Investigations  (DCI),  Ethics  and  Anti-\\nCorruption  Commission  (EACC)  and  Kenya  Revenue  Authority  (KRA)  among  other \\ninstitutions  are  now  preoccupied  with  hurling  to  court  public  officers  for  the  minor \\nadministrative  mistakes.  That  is  why  I  will  be  proposing  an  amendment  to  the  Public \\nProcurement and Asset Disposal Act 2015.   \\n\\nThis House needs to give impetus to technology, innovation and sustainability in order \\ngive solutions  to  the challenges in  the society,  I  will urge that the House prioritises making \\nlaws that anchor technology as a solution to the challenges that we face as a country. \\n\\nClimate change is a reality, and I will urge this House to consider climate financing to \\n\\nhelp the marginalised communities in this country.   \\n\\nI look forward to serving the country in my new capacity, and I thank you, Hon. Deputy \\n\\nSpeaker. \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker:  Thank you, Member for Mbeere North. You were also quite \\n\\nbrief, which means that many of our colleagues will have an opportunity to speak. \\n\\nI now call upon Nominated Member, Hon. John Mbadi. \\nHon. John Mbadi (Nominated, ODM):  Thank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nLet me start by congratulating you for being elected as the Deputy Speaker of this House.  Last \\ntime I made my contribution, I congratulated the Speaker, but I had not congratulated you.  I \\nhave no doubt that you will lead this House to conduct its affairs diligently and objectively. I \\nalso  hope  that  the  four  Members  who  are  going  to  constitute  the  Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Panel  will  be \\nMembers who possess experience and ability to help you run the House.  \\n\\nHaving  said  that,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  allow  me  to  make  my  contributions  to  the \\nSpeech of the President. First, this House has a collective responsibility to oversee and hold \\nthe Executive to account as a unit. I am also a live to the fact that the Minority side of the House \\nor the opposition as it used to be called, has an extra responsibility to even hold the Executive \\nto account much more. I am sure that we are not going to provide parochial opposition, but an \\nobjective opposition. We will support Government policies that are geared towards bettering \\nthe lives of Kenyans and only oppose those  policies which would make us roll back on the \\ngains that this country has made so far. So, you should expect a robust, informed and objective \\nopposition from us, which will help the country to move forward.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the President is taking over a country that is divided right down \\nin the middle; a country where 50 per cent voted for him and another near 50 per cent did not \\nvote for him. This is a country that requires a real symbol of national unity. I am happy that the \\nPresident  indicated  in  his  speech  that  he  is  going  to  run  a  united  country.  He  also  said  that \\nservice delivery is going to be given to all Kenyans in equal measure, regardless of where one \\nvoted, because we are all taxpayers. That is something that needs to be lauded. What we are \\nnow waiting for is action.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the only thing that I would have requested, is that the Deputy \\nPresident also follows what the President has said. I was a bit disturbed when the news came \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c11th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                 9 \\n\\nout that the Deputy President said something to the effect that it is their turn to eat. I hope he \\nwas misquoted. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, public appointments, including positions of Principal Secretaries \\n(PSs) belong to all Kenyans. Those are positions in the Public and Civil Service, and they are \\nnot supposed to be used as a reward for political support. They belong to all of us, whether one \\nvoted  for  Azimio  la  Umoja  -  One  Kenya  Alliance  or  Kenya  Kwanza.  How  I  wish  that  the \\nDeputy President understood that. So, we expect the Public Service Commission (PSC) to be \\nimpartial, and not to be a victim of state capture.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHaving  said  that,  something  that  worries  me  a  lot  is  that  however  short  or  brief  the \\nSpeech of the President was, I expected it to at least have a line on devolution. If the President \\ncould remember the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF), which \\nI support, as a very progressive Fund, then I wonder how he could forget to mention something \\non devolution. He even spoke about the Senate Oversight Fund, but he did not say a thing on \\ndevolution. \\nDevolution  is  the  one  thing  that  has  changed  the  architecture  of  governance  in  this \\n \\ncountry since 2013. This is something that should always find space in the speech of a President \\nof the republic of Kenya. I assume it could be because he was summarising his speech, that is \\nwhy he probably left it out among the very many volumes that I saw he did not read. I could \\nsee that the President read a portion of his speech and decided to leave out others. Being an \\nintelligent man, he must have summarised it in a way that we could not even notice that he left \\nout some. I just want to assume that devolution was part of the rest of his speech, because it \\nwould worry me if it did not.  \\n \\nThe President talked a lot about the economy in his short speech, and even proposed \\nthat  he  will  start  by  cutting  our  budget  by  about  Ksh300  billion.  I  thought  that  was  a  bit \\nambitious,  but  I  am  waiting  to  see,  through  the  Supplementary  Budget,  what  the  National \\nTreasury has for us to actualise the pronouncements by the President. However, I do not think \\nthe solution is on the quantum of the Budget as such, or the cutting down of it. I think we should \\nfocus, as a country, on misuse of resources, governance issues and fiscal discipline; what you \\ncould call corruption.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I do not understand why the President finds it hard to call out \\ncorruption by its name. I rarely hear my President talk about corruption. He will always cut \\ncorners and use language that is close to corruption, but he will not call it corruption. I would \\nwant  President  William  Ruto  to  call  corruption  by  its  name.  The  one  thing  that  he  should \\ndisobey  in  his  policy  of  bottom-up  is  corruption.  This  one  must  be  toned  down.  It  must  be \\nfought top-down; you cannot fight it bottom-up. The President, who is the head of this country \\nmust  come  out  forthrightly  and  forcefully  to  call  corruption  by  its  name  and  make  life \\nunbearable for those who are corrupt. These are the people who are making our budget to be \\ninflated and the country to lack resources to implement the projects needed. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I want to advise the Executive \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is if they can take my advice \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 that time is running out, and that the honeymoon is over. Today is exactly 30 days since they \\nwere sworn into office, yet the Deputy President is still talking as if he does not believe. If you \\ndo not believe, yet Kenyans are expecting service delivery, do you want us to believe? Please \\nbelieve and start delivering services. We want the cost of living as well as price of fuel to come \\ndown. Do not talk about the Ukraine-Russia war now. During the campaigns, you said that had \\nnothing to do with this crisis. Now we join in saying that Ukraine is very far from Kenya. We \\nwant the price of fuel and petroleum products to come down. The price  of unga must come \\ndown to Ksh80, as we were promised. There is no more time to move around.  \\nThe President has already sold himself internationally as a Kenyan leader. Therefore, \\n \\nwe want him here back home. Very soon, we are going to give you your Cabinet. Once you \\nhave the Cabinet, please perform. Kenyans do not want any more waste of time, because the \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

However,  we  will  support  you  to  make  sure  that  this \\neconomy is resuscitated only with good policies. \\n\\nI thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n Hon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Now I call upon the ranking Member for Garissa \\n\\n \\nTownship Constituency.  \\n \\nHon. Aden Duale (Garissa Township, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I will \\nnot take much time in contributing to the Speech of the President. I have done it three times; I \\nhave contributed to the speeches of the late President Kibaki, former President Uhuru Kenyatta, \\nand now to the only President and a friend of mine, President William Ruto.  \\n\\n Hon. Deputy Speaker for the first time, I think his speech was only one hour. Members \\nwho were here last time will remember that the former President Uhuru left his speech halfway. \\nI think he even left it at the Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place. For those who write speeches, you do not allow \\nthe  President  to  repeat.  President  William  Ruto  did  not  repeat  what  he  said  during  his \\ninauguration, and his inaugural address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). He \\nwill not repeat what he said yesterday, but say what is there today. The key area to pick was to \\nmake sure that the Big Four agenda in the plan are implemented, like the UHC and affordable \\ncheap housing for every Kenyan to live in a decent House where they turn the payment of rent \\ninto ownership of houses. \\n\\n Thirdly  is  to  make  sure  that  Kenya  is  food  secure.  Even  before  his  Cabinet  sits,  he \\nreduced  the  price  of  fertiliser,  which  was  among  his  first  promises.  He  is  dealing  with  the \\ndrought as we speak today. He appointed the six judges who the Constitution had allowed, but \\nbecause of impunity, the former President refused to have them sworn in. He called Safaricom \\nand told them that the owners of  Fuliza are known, and that they should reduce the service \\ncharge by 80 per cent.  Hon. Mbadi, a ranking Member, in 30 days, what President William \\nRuto has done, other Presidents have not done in two years.  \\n\\nFor corruption, watch this space. If you were involved in the Kenya Medical Supplies \\nAgency (KEMSA) scandal or have a file, whether you belong to Kenya Kwanza Coalition or \\nto the opposition, he categorically said he will empower and support financially the oversight \\nin  independent  institutions.  Some  of  those  institutions  were,  for  five  years,  captured  by  the \\nState mandarins. For example, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution (ODPP), the \\nEACC, the Office of the Auditor-General among others. Hon. Wandayi said that when I served \\nas  Member  of  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  (PAC),  that  the  Controller  of  Budget  was \\nharassed  by  the  Cabinet  Secretary  (CS)  for  National  Treasury  and  Planning.  If  there  is  an \\nincident in any constituency, the Inspector-General (IG) of Police today has the capacity and \\nthe financial muscle to do his operations without any hindrance. All these were done within 30 \\ndays. President William Ruto will either be like President Kibaki, who left us with a debt of \\nKsh1.8 trillion, or be better. I am one person who believes that if Kenya will not change under \\nthe  leadership  of  the  chief  hustler,  it  will  never  change.  There  is  optimism  and  a  lot  of \\nexcitement  in  the  region  and  Africa.  Never  have  you  seen  21  Presidents  coming  for \\ninauguration. There used to be a handful of around 10 to 15. Kenya is a hub. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, we have a young, energetic, sober President who only takes tea \\nlike me. He is a good listener, and one who believes in the unity of the people. Since he was in \\nthe Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), the United Republican Party (URP), the Jubilee \\ncoalition,  and  the  United  Democratic  Alliance  (UDA),  he  has  never  appointed  any  of  his \\nrelatives to this House. Compare that. His party has been appointing the marginalised women. \\nHe is a person who listens to them. Let us judge His Excellency William Ruto in a very fair \\nway, even if you are in the opposition.  \\n\\nToday,  I  am  very  happy  that  my  colleague,  a  ranking  Hon.  Member,  has  really \\nconfirmed to all and sundry that he has taken his place in the minority and in the opposition. \\nThis country needs effective and robust opposition. It was not there last time. Last time, we did \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It gave us extra Kshs7 trillion, and that is why we need to reconfigure the budget. \\nIn this House, the budget of the Parliamentary Service Commission must be ready to be slashed. \\nWe must not rush for the Chinese loans anymore. We must borrow, if we have to borrow, from \\nthe multi-laterals that will give us cheaper rates at 3 per cent  for longer periods. We do not \\nwant these Chinese who come with their companies and Kenyans lose because they offload \\ntheir population to Kenya. Imagine a Chinese truck driver in a construction site. This House \\nmust  rise  to  the  occasion.  If  the  House  approves  me,  I  will  not  allow  Kenyan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  place  to  be \\noccupied by foreigners.  \\n\\nDear colleagues, and because majority of you are new, I really want to ask you to make \\nlaws  that  will  help  our  country.  Even  when  the  Government  brings  laws,  scrutinise  them.  I \\nthink everybody now knows that the \\xe2\\x80\\x98deep state\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and the \\xe2\\x80\\x98system\\xe2\\x80\\x99 are fallacies. I am sure the \\nchief is no longer deep state. The county commissioners have realised that they are not deep \\nstate. The DPP could not work, as he was under orders to choose which file to take to court. \\nThe EACC had gun on their heads. They were told: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook for the file of Hon. Aden Duale and \\ndo not take this one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Judiciary was muscled. The Controller of Budget could not say that \\ncounties have overshot their recurrent expenditure. Our counties are employing 50 to 60 per \\ncent outside the Public Finance Management (PFM) Act requirement of 35 per cent.  \\n\\nHon. Mbadi and team, you will watch from TV the way this country will change. I have \\nno doubt. In 2002, Hon. Kiraitu Murungi said that President Moi should go home and buy a \\nTV. I am telling you to buy a TV, and may God give you more years to live and watch how \\nHis Excellency President William Samoei arap Ruto will transform this country. Please, buy \\nTV.  That  will  later  come  down.  Hon  Mbadi  and  the  rest,  in  30  days,  we  have  stopped  the \\nsubsidy of petroleum products. I am not a CS, but a Member for Garissa Township.  \\n\\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, you need to protect me. I am a Member and I want to thank the \\npeople of Garissa Township. They elected me four times in four different political parties; that \\nis ODM, URP, Jubilee Coalition and now UDA. That tells you that they have the confidence \\nin my leadership.  I moved with President William Ruto, who they told me to walk with. He \\ntook me to ODM and URP, but I did not mind because I was a pastoralist. \\n\\nI am so happy that what I said many years ago \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that I will retire in politics when His \\nExcellency William Ruto is in Statehouse \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has been achieved; and may God bless Kenya and \\nthe Government of William Ruto. I hope that this House will provide leadership.  \\n\\nI know that we have a very vibrant opposition. We have very good leaders on the other \\n\\nside. Let us all work together to protect the interests of our people. \\n\\nThank you. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you.  \\nWe will now have the Member for Konoin, who will be followed by the Member for \\n\\nNandi County, and then the Member for Matungu in that order so that you can be ready.  \\n\\nHon. Brighton  Yegon  (Konoin, UDA):  Thank  you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.   I would \\nlike to thank the people of Konoin for giving me a second chance and voting me for the second \\ntime to be in this House to represent their interests. I also appreciate the people of Kenya for \\nvoting  in  President  William  Samoei  Ruto  and  his  Deputy,  Hon.  Rigathi  Gachagua.  I  also \\ncongratulate you and Hon. Speaker for being elected in the House to serve in this Parliament. \\nIn his Speech, the President captured a number of fundamental issues that are in the \\nKenya Kwanza manifesto. They include food, nutrition and security. The mission to scale up \\nproduction  in  agriculture  while  creating  jobs  is  one  of  the  fundamental  issues  that  was \\nmentioned. Eighty per cent of farming activities in Konoin Constituency revolves around tea. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

In  the  spirit  of  employment  that  is  born  through  agricultural  production,  these \\nmultinationals have exhibited some misbehaviour and bad manners. They have actually sent \\nhome  more  than  15,000  employees  through  forced  early  retirement,  redundancy  and \\ndisciplinary dismissal. This has actually rendered very many of my constituents jobless due to \\nintroduction of tea picking machines. This has done more harm than good.  \\n\\nWe need to call upon these multinational companies to exercise restraint and balance \\nbetween  mechanisation  to  optimize  profits  and  employment.  As  much  as  we  appreciate \\nmechanisation, the multinational companies must also appreciate that the only benefit we get \\nfrom  them  is  employment.  When  they  are  no  longer  employing  our  people,  they  will  have \\noutlived  their  usefulness.  I  am  calling  upon  these  multinational  companies  to  think  about \\nbalancing between mechanisation to optimize profits and employment, so that we can have as \\nmany people as possible employed.  \\n\\nThe President emphasised on the Hustler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fund. This is actually to support Small and \\nMedium  Enterprises  (SMEs)  through  affordable  credit  that  will  allow  them  to  expand \\nbusinesses for mama mboga, kinyozi and the boda boda industry for them to thrive and expand \\nin line with the bottom-up economic model.   \\n\\nThe President also talked about matters of water. He talked about raising the target of \\naccess to water from the current 60 per cent to 80 per cent. In my constituency, there was a \\nproject called Bosto Water Project. The water project was supposed to serve five constituencies \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 four constituencies in Bomet and one constituency in Kericho County. The project was to be \\nfinanced by the Chinese Exim Bank but the previous regime sabotaged it for political reasons. \\nIn the spirit of raising the target of water coverage from 60 to 80 per cent, we hope, pray and \\nbeseech  this  Government  to  jumpstart  the  project  because  the  money  is  still  lying  at  the \\nNational Treasury. So, the project can start as soon as possible and we can access clean tap \\nwater.  \\n\\nThere is the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), which the President spoke about. \\nThe NHIF should be restructured to enable it become fit as a social insurance scheme that caters \\nfor all, including those with chronic illnesses. It should cater for terminal diseases like cancer, \\nas the disease has drained many families\\xe2\\x80\\x99 resources. Many families have sold their land and \\nproperty  to  pay  for  hospital  bills.  Since  the  Kenya  Kwanza  Government  has  promised  to \\nrestructure NHIF, we appreciate it. That is a plausible initiative. \\n\\nThe  President  talked  about  the  National  Government  Constituencies  Development \\nFund (NG-CDF). He said it should be aligned to the Constitution because it has had a huge \\nimpact  in  our society. The bursaries that we give to  orphans and other vulnerable people in \\nsociety have helped them to achieve their goals.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. God bless Kenya.  \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Next is the Member for Nandi County. \\nHon. Cynthia Muge (Nandi County, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I stand \\nhere privileged to be part of the 13th Parliament. This privilege and honour has been bestowed \\nupon me by the great people of Nandi County. I want to pass my sincere gratitude to them for \\nhaving seen value in me by voting overwhelmingly for me on 9th August 2022, to come to this \\nHouse. I want to tell them that I am indebted to them and will ensure that I serve them selflessly \\nand  pay  back  whatever  they  did  on  the  9th  August  by  ensuring  that  I  give  responsive  and \\nresponsible leadership.  \\n\\nI want to say that my voice is their voice in this House.

I will speak for every special group and every boy \\nand man who is trying to find a footing in their lives.  \\n\\nThat said, I am a new Hon. Member in this House. My name is Cynthia Muge. I was \\nborn and raised in Nandi, probably for Nandi and this country at large. I am a daughter, a wife \\nand a mother, all that in one complete package. By training, I am a physical planner who was \\ntrained  and  educated  at  the  University  of  Nairobi,  with  a  Bachelors  and  a  Master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  degree. \\nEvery person will be wondering how this person ended up in this House. My political journey \\nstarted  five  years  ago  in  2017  when  I  was  a  young  girl,  a  tiny  girl  who  would  pass  for  a \\nuniformed Form Two girl. I went into the murky waters of politics and contested for a Member \\nof County Assembly seat. I ran, and I thank God I was given the opportunity to serve the people \\nof Kilibwoni Ward. I want to thank the great people of Kilibwoni. It is the star and the seed \\nthat they planted in 2017 that has eventually grown very broad leaves that today covers the \\nwhole county. I want to say thank you to those great people.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the easiest part is done. The easiest part was to be elected. The \\nhardest part now begins. The responsibility given to me is no a joke. It is enormous. I come \\nfrom the same village with Chelagat Mutai, who was elected to this august House at the age of \\n24 years. She did a great job in this House. She stood for the people and fought for their land \\nrights. Therefore, the people of Uasin Gishu got land. I cannot fit in her shoes, so to speak. This \\nis because those shoes were worn at a different point in life and in a different era where things \\nwere done differently. So, I will take her lessons seriously and wear shoes of my size going \\nforward.  \\n\\nI hope to speak up in this House, play my constitutional role and represent the people. \\nSo, those I represent and Kenyans at large will see value for their money and every coin used \\nby this Government. Of course, we have the assurance of the President that his administration \\nwill rely on the oversight role of this Assembly. So, I will play that role without demonisation \\nof checks and balances. I hope through me, Kenya Kwanza will be able to implement its plans \\nand fulfil its promises to the people of Kenya.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I want to say a few words about the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, which \\nhe  made  last  week.  For  the  first  time,  we  have  a  President  who  is  careful  and  detailed.  He \\nremembered to count the number of women who were elected to this House and the number of \\nMembers who came back. This tells you a lot about him. He is a President whom, during his \\ncampaign  trail,  spoke  about  the  economy.  He  is  keen  on  ensuring  that  the  economy  of  this \\ncountry is back to where it was left by the late Mwai Kibaki and even better.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  I  remember  that  the  President  also  spoke  about  healthcare.  It \\nshould be noted that any person who speaks about savings is a futuristic person. He is a person \\nwho looks into the future with a view to ensuring that it will be enjoyed by everyone.  He also \\nspoke about the Hustler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fund, taxation and housing issues affecting the people of Kenya.  \\n\\nIn as much as many Hon. Members have said that his Speech was short, I want to say \\nthat every person who has the story header has the full story. I want everyone to know that the \\nPresident was trying to be brief and avoid being boring. He had the content, details, plans and \\nroadmap on what will happen in this country.  I hope all the Members in this House will be \\ninstrumental in their representation, oversight and legislation roles to ensure that the President \\ndelivers. \\n\\n Hon. Deputy Speaker, I want to thank you, the Hon. Members of this House and the \\ngreat people of Nandi for according me this golden opportunity to speak in this House as their \\nrepresentative.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.   \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you, Member for Nandi County for keeping time. I now \\ncall upon the Member for Matungu. Thereafter, we will have the Member for Busia County, \\nHon.

Oscar Nabulindo (Matungu, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for giving \\nme this chance to address the 13th Parliament and talk to the people of Matungu. First, I take \\nthis opportunity to congratulate you for having been elected as the Deputy Speaker of the 13th \\nParliament.  \\n\\nI also want to congratulate my mentor and friend, Hon. Moses Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula for having \\nbeen elected as the Speaker of this House. I have a history with him because he is my political \\nmentor.  When  I  left  employment  in  Parliament,  he  was  the  first  person  to  embrace  me \\npolitically. He campaigned for me, gave me a ticket in his party and has mentored me up to \\nthis point in time.  \\n\\nSecondly, I take this opportunity to sincerely thank the people of Matungu for having \\noverwhelmingly voted for me twice in a span of two years. First in 2021 and second in 2022. \\nThis is a show of the confidence they have in me. I embrace it, promise to work for them and \\nensure that I achieve what I promised them during the campaigns. \\n\\n Let me take this opportunity to say a few words about the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech in this \\n13th Parliament. First, I applaud him for acknowledging the fact that the National Government \\nConstituencies  Development  Fund  (NG-CDF) \\nthe  constituencies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\ndevelopment. He encouraged us to work out something that can align it with the Constitution \\nso  that  it  can  work  for  the  Members  of  Parliament  and  constituents,  who  are  the  direct \\nbeneficiaries.  \\n\\nimportant  for \\n\\nis \\n\\nBy  all means,  everybody understands that the NG-CDF  is  an important  fund for the \\ndevelopment of constituencies. Millions and millions of children have been educated through \\nthe NG-CDF, and a lot has been achieved. Unfortunately, it is only the Judiciary that does not \\nunderstand the importance of this fund, but that is a matter for another day.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, other than that, I want to register my disappointments. This is \\nbecause the President did not give any commitment on the revival of the sugar industry in the \\nwestern region, and more so the revival of Mumias Sugar Company. I am a representative of \\nthe people of Matungu and for many years they depended on Mumias Sugar Company 100 per \\ncent.  \\n\\nMumias  Sugar  Company  collapsed  with  dreams  and  aspirations  of  the  people  of \\nMatungu and Mumias at large. It is very imperative for the Government of the day to give some \\nimportance to the revival of the sugar industry. We have sleepless nights, and we are saddened \\nwhen the Government of the day decides to ignore the issue of Mumias Sugar Company. This \\nis because it is a very thorny issue to us. The residents of Matungu are desperate since it was \\ntheir only livelihood. We depended on that company 100 per cent to achieve all our dreams. \\nUnfortunately, it collapsed. All efforts to revive the sugar company over the years have failed. \\nFor whatever reasons, everything that has been tried to revive that company has failed. Right \\nnow,  we  have  a  businessman  who  is  trying  to  revive  it  but  there  are  numerous  court  cases \\nongoing to  stop  its revival.  It  is  high time the  Government  intervened  and ensured that this \\ncompany stands on its feet for the benefit of the people of that region.  \\n\\nThe people of Matungu are tired of being told to move from sugarcane farming. We are \\nnot going to move on. This is because sugarcane farming is the only business we know. We \\nhave tried everything else and it has failed. We have tried maize, sorghum, cassavas and even \\navocado farming but nothing works for us. Therefore, we want  our sugarcane back and it is \\nonly  the  Government  that  can  help  us.  If  it  cannot  help  us,  then  we  shall  remain  hopeless \\nbecause we are not going to move on. We are not going to do other things. So, people should \\nstop telling us to move on. We are going to farm sugarcane, and we want it revived. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the issue of youth employment did not come out strongly in the \\nPresident\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech. Seventy-five per cent of this country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population consist of the youths. \\nWhere do we then take them? There is no elaborate plan for youth employment in this country. \\nNeither is there one for people to rise against poverty. We hear of the Hustler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fund.

This  will  enable  them  to  re-plant  sugarcane  and \\nsupply it to  Mumias Sugar Company and other sugar  companies.  If the fund is  utilized that \\nway, it will lead to revival of the sugarcane farming industry.   \\n\\n This  country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  economy  is  in  shambles  and  everyone  agrees.  Instead  of  the \\nGovernment  joining  the  wananchi  in  crying  about  the  bad  economy,  it  should  give  us  an \\nelaborate plan on what they are going to do to revive the economy in the shortest time possible.  \\nThere is a plan that was elaborated by the President \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that, we should cut down costs. \\nInstead, why should the Government not come up with a wealth creation method? We are not \\nin the mood of cutting costs but rather of creating wealth. Nobody is ready to surrender their \\nallowances or whatever they have targeted just because we want to revive the economy. The \\nfirst step is for the Government to give us an elaborate plan on how to revive this country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\neconomy, and how small enterprises are going to get a boost or a kickstart to be empowered \\ninstead of waiting to be employed in a white-collar job economy. \\n\\nWith those few remarks, I beg to support. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Can the Member for Busia have the Floor? \\nHon. Catherine Omanyo (Busia County, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.  \\n First, I want to thank the people of Busia for overwhelmingly voting me in. It was a \\nlandslide  win  for  me.  I  will  not  take  it  for  granted  because  the  task  ahead  of  me  is  to  keep \\nserving them.  \\n\\nI  have  issues  I  want  addressed  and  become  history  in  Busia  County.  They  include \\nchildren  crossing  swamps  in  order  for  them  to  get  to  school,  release  of  fishermen  jailed  in \\nUganda for not fishing on the Kenyan side of the lake, and helping widows, elderly persons \\nand Persons living with Disabilities (PWDs)in order for them to know that they now have a \\nmother.  I want to thank them for believing that I can take care of them. \\n\\nThe President, in his Speech, did not mention Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) \\nfood  but  he  is  nonetheless  already  implementing  it.  Is  he  ignorant  of  the  disadvantages  of \\nGMOs? From where I sit, GMOs are toxic to our bodies and cause loss of nutrition. We already \\nhave children and adults who are suffering from malnutrition in Kenya. Why then should we \\nbring such a thing to our nation?  They also cause cancer and antibiotic resistance. As Members \\nof Parliament and leaders of this nation, we should be brought to knowledge of some things \\nbefore they are introduced to us. Kenya has natural habitats and very fertile soils. We would \\nnot like to downgrade it. \\n\\nThe President also did not mention the issue of perforated boundaries yet we recently \\nwitnessed Kenyans dying like chicken in Baringo yet the people who perpetrate the killings are \\nknown. As a mother, I wept. Nobody should be sleeping pretty waiting to dig graves in Kenya. \\nWe want to lead people who are alive and Kenyans should not live in fear. \\n\\nThank you.  \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Tigania West. He seems not to be here. We can \\n\\nthen have the Member for Ugenya. \\n\\nHon. David Ochieng\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Ugenya, MDG): Thank you so much, Hon. Deputy Speaker.  \\nAllow me to join fellow Members in congratulating you for being elected the Deputy \\nSpeaker of the 13th Parliament. I know who you are. I know that you take matters seriously. \\nThis Parliament is in good hands with you as the Deputy Speaker.  \\n\\nAllow me to also take this opportunity to thank the people of Ugenya, who against all \\nodds have stood with me to see me come back to Parliament even when everyone thought I \\nwould not. Even those who cared had written me off.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Some  people  think  that  they  just  happen.  We \\nmust thank Kenyans for being peaceful, civil and mature democratically. You will appreciate \\nthe  fact  that  our  democracy  is  growing  and  maturing  if  you  see  what  happens  in  our \\nneighbouring countries. A time will come when elections will just be a matter of course, and \\nwill not cause jitters and panic in the country. If you looked at status of the economy before \\nthe elections and now, and if you remember what we went through during the elections, you \\nwill appreciate the fact that the President recognizes that we have come far in our democracy, \\nwhich  is  very  important.  The  fact  that  our  democracy  is  maturing  should  not  be  taken  for \\ngranted.  We  must  continue  nurturing  it.  The  President  has  promised  to  run  an  accountable, \\nopen and transparent Government. As the National Assembly, we must encourage him to do \\nso. Those of us in the Kenya Kwanza Alliance, will ensure that the President carries out his \\nrole in a manner that follows the law. \\n\\nAs someone said earlier, our President is not averse to criticism. He does not want us \\nto be a choir in this Assembly. He has said that he does not have monopoly of knowledge. He \\nwants to share the views of the people of this country and Parliament to ensure that what the \\ncountry  needs  gets  into  his  thinking  and  interacts  with  his  thoughts.  He  has  said  that  this \\nParliament should not be timid and sit back but should oversee his Government accordingly. I \\nwant to invite all of us to give the President the challenge and ensure that he runs a Government \\nthat responds to the needs of the people.  \\n\\nSecond and most important, is the place of education in the growth of our economy. \\nThe hustler nation does not mean that we throw education out and anything goes. The hustler \\nnation means that everybody who has a chance and wants to get an education, who wants to \\nget his or her papers right or who wants to grow by ensuring that his or her children accesses \\nthe best quality education in this country, is able to get it. The President wants to run a country \\nbased on merit. So, I ask all of us not to give up on education. It is a key thing. That is why \\nwhen I hear the courts rule that anybody can run for governor or Member of Parliament, and \\nthat education does not matter, I feel that we are sending the wrong signals. \\n\\n I ask all of us to ensure that wherever we come from, education is the only equaliser to \\nanything in this world. If you did not go to school, you will not end up anywhere. Investing in \\neducation is something that we must keep talking about so as to ensure that we are led by the \\nbest as a country. The former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, said that you must \\nbe led by the best in your midst and those who know what is required in the country.  \\n\\nThe President talked about investing in agriculture. Our country is agriculture-based. \\nAs a people, we must ensure that we become food secure. How do we do so? We must invest \\nat  the  lowest  levels  of  the  economy.  Everyone  who  wants  to  farm  should  be  able  to  access \\nquality and affordable seeds, whether they are avocados, cotton, maize, millet or potatoes, as \\nwell as fertilisers. Let us ensure that everybody who is willing to use his or her energy to benefit \\nand earn a living in this country is supported. That is why we will ensure that this Parliament \\nsorts out the supply and demand constraints on agriculture. Let us ensure that our people are \\ntaught. Let us bring back the service officers that used to help us in agriculture. Let us ensure \\nthat our people know the modern methods of farming, cooling milk and that our farm produce \\ndoes not go to waste because we do not have storage facilities.  \\n\\nIrrigation is very important for food security and stability. The failure of Galana-Kulalu \\nis very fresh in our minds. The failure of dams is very fresh in our minds. As an Assembly, we \\nwill ensure that there is money set aside for irrigation to ensure that our people become food \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

We must ensure  that the money is  used for the right  reasons.  Corruption should not \\nseep into monies meant to benefit our people. \\n\\n I have heard so many Members say that the President did not talk about corruption. I \\ndo not believe that barking and shouting at corruption makes it go away. The approach adopted \\nby our President to ensure that institutions that are supposed to fight corruption are well-funded, \\nwell-resourced and well-equipped speaks for itself.  \\n\\nI was in  the last Parliament  when the former President brought  us a list of Principal \\nSecretaries and Cabinet Secretaries who he claimed were corrupt. To date, none of them has \\never been convicted by a court of law. I do not think we should ask our President to talk about \\ncorruption. We should ask those whom we have given that job to do by law. There is no law \\nthat requires the President to fight corruption. The law that was passed by the Assembly, and \\nthat  which  is  set  out  in  the  Constitution,  establishes  the  Ethics  and  Anti-Corruption \\nCommission  (EACC)  as  the  body  that  fights  corruption;  not  the  President.  We  want  the \\nPresident to ensure that he does not try to stop any prosecutions or investigations. However, \\nsaying that the President must talk about, or fight corruption is quite weak.  \\n\\nWe have had guys who talked about corruption every day, saying that they would fight \\nit and deal with it but people steal right under their noses, and they do not talk about it. The \\napproach  by  the  President  to  nurture  institutions  is  the  best.  On  this  issue,  I  insist  that  the \\nDirectorate of Criminal  Investigations (DCI), the EACC and our courts are to blame. As an \\nAssembly, we must ensure that we put them on their toes, not the President. Corruption seeps \\neverywhere  in  this  country,  including  in  nursery  and  primary  schools.  There  is  corruption \\neverywhere you go. I do not think the President has a thousand eyes to check how we live. In \\nmy opinion, fighting corruption requires a concerted effort. We must all play a role. We should \\nnot just say corruption is bad and when you are found to be corrupt, you say it is a witch-hunt. \\nWe must put the blame where it lies.  \\n\\nThe President proposed a very good housing project. All we need to do as an Assembly \\nis to ensure that if a house is being built in Kisumu, the doors are bought in Kisumu. If you are \\nbuilding houses in Kakamega, let the doors, hinges and windows be produced in Kakamega. \\n\\nFinally, Hon. Deputy Speaker, this President means well. We cannot pray that he fails. \\nIf he fails, we fail. I ask all of us here, both the Majority and the Minority sides, to pray for this \\nPresident to succeed. Let us help him succeed for if he succeeds, we succeed; and the country \\nsucceeds.  \\n\\nThank you so much.  \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Let us hear the Member for Baringo North.  \\nHon. Joseph Makilap (Baringo North, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. First \\nand foremost, I thank God through the people of Baringo North, who gave me an opportunity \\nto become a Member of Parliament in this 13th Parliament, a dream that started in 1984 when \\nI was in Standard Four. When I saw Parliament then, I said that that was truly where I shall be \\nin  many  years  to  come.  I  also  thank  the  people  of  Baringo  North  in  all  their  wards,  their \\nreligious  leaders,  those  who  prayed  for  me  and  the  Simba  ni  Moja  campaign  team,  which \\ndelivered victory in military precision.  \\n\\nI also thank the people of Baringo North, together with the people of Kenya, for giving \\nHis Excellency the President William Samoei Ruto an opportunity to become the fifth President \\nof the Republic of Kenya, together with his Deputy, Rigathi Gachagua. More specifically, over \\nthe weekend, the people of Baringo North told me to convey thanks to the people of Mount \\nKenya who gave us many votes, together with other Kenyans who gave us an opportunity to \\nelect His Excellency President William Samoei Ruto as our fifth President.  \\n\\nAs elected representatives, we had an opportunity to elect you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, \\nand the Speaker of the National Assembly. I congratulate you first, as citizens, secondly, as \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Congratulations,  Hon. \\nDeputy Speaker, together with the Speaker of the National Assembly.  \\n\\nNow  turning  to  the  President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Speech,  His  Excellency  President  William  Ruto  is  a \\nproduct of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work. This is a man who was fought by all manner of things, including by \\nthe  system,  Government  machinery  and  State  capture  but  through  prayers,  none  of  them \\nsucceeded. It gives us freedom as a country that the son of a pauper from a village, like me, \\nwhose first mattress was the skin of a cow, can one day rise to become the President of Kenya.  \\nI also want to congratulate the Members who have been elected for the first time, just \\nlike myself, to be in this 13th Parliament. They are being referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x98monos\\xe2\\x80\\x99. We may be \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98monos\\xe2\\x80\\x99 here, but mentally we are not \\xe2\\x80\\x98monos\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and we cannot be taken for a ride. We have the \\npower to debate and propose legislation that can actually change the country into a positive \\ntrajectory. To our senior colleagues, I also want to congratulate you because you utilised the \\nNational Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF) well and it brought you \\nback here. Teach us how to come back the next time we face elections. \\n\\nOn the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, the Kenya Kwanza Government has a bigger mandate across \\nthe political divide in this country. In the last election, William Samoei Ruto got 25 per cent in \\n39  counties.  The  performance  has  progressively  moved  from  30  counties  in  2013  and  34 \\ncounties in 2017 to 39 counties in this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s election. That means he has a broader mandate \\nand acceptance across Kenya. That is why immediately the results were announced and even \\nduring the Supreme Court judgment, Kenyans kept their cool and gave the country a breathing \\nspace to be able to transact business. \\n\\nOn unity of purpose, we have one President. Any other person is subject to the President \\nand must transact business in a manner that is acceptable to all Kenyans regardless of how they \\nvoted in the last election. Similarly, whether my constituents voted for me or not, I will serve \\nthem justly because it was a competition. Once we have a winner, we should treat all people \\nthe same way without discrimination. Even the nominees for Cabinet appointment are spread \\nacross Kenya. That brings unity in our country.  \\n\\nOn the matter of what is called Fuliza, access to credit by the people of Kenya is not \\nenough. I want to congratulate the President for intervening, but it is not enough. I was doing \\nresearch and realised that the base interest rate of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates \\n(UAE) is 4.5 per cent. I am looking forward to a time when a borrower in Kenya will access \\nloans at 3 per cent per annum so that they will be able to do business. For a long time in this \\ncountry, Kenyans have been working for banks instead of banks working for Kenyans. I will \\nbe one of those Members of Parliament who will propose legislation to bring down interest \\nrates charged on Kenyans who borrow money to do business. That is the only way we can make \\nprofits, have businesses that prosper and even reduce taxes. \\n\\nThe biggest town in my constituency is called Kabarnet. Women go to Uganda to bring \\nclothes.  I  wonder  how  people  go  to  a  landlocked  country  like  Uganda  to  buy  goods  and \\nservices.  Why?  It  is  because  there  are  too  many  taxes  in  our  country.  We  should  look  at  a \\nsituation where we reduce taxes, including Value Added Tax (VAT). If we were able to reduce \\nVAT during the outbreak of COVID-19, why can we not reduce it now when the situation is \\nnormal? We should reduce VAT to 12 per cent so that Kenyans can do business. The \\xe2\\x80\\x98hustler \\nnation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Government talks about spreading bottom taxes so that we have more productivity but \\nwe can also reduce VAT and PAYE. The other day when we were being served with payslips, \\nI could see money being given by the right hand and taken by the left hand. As Members of \\nthis House, we must look at legislation to ensure taxes do not become punitive to the people of \\nKenya. We must reduce taxes to attract investors to bring money to our country so that we can \\ndo much more and develop as a country. \\n\\nI  want  to  agree  with  His  Excellency  the  President  on  the  issue  of  agriculture  and \\nirrigation.

Members, if we do not ensure food security in this country\\xe2\\x80\\x94if our stomachs \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

In  the  coming  years,  I  will  do  more  in  this \\nParliament to reshape the direction of development in this country. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you.

Ibrahim  Saney  (Wajir  North,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker.  This \\nbeing the last afternoon to discuss the Presidential Address, I kindly seek your indulgence to \\ndirect the House to reduce time allocated for each Member to five minutes so that we can have \\nample time to contribute to the Speech. In as much as we know that we are yet to make our \\nmaiden speeches, I implore you to reduce the speaking time for each Member to five minutes. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Given that the debate had already begun, that can only happen \\n\\nif the House so agrees. There was another intervention by the Member for Kajiado East. \\n\\nHon. Kakuta Maimai (Kajiado East, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I want \\nto second the proposal by the Member. Every Member wants to get an opportunity to contribute \\nto the Speech of the President. So, I support. \\n\\nThank you. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, since it is not procedural to change speaking \\ntime in the middle of debate, I think that is something Members can agree upon. Whoever gets \\nthe next opportunity, try to make your contribution as brief as you can. Some Members have \\nalready done so. I think we can proceed. \\n\\nMember for Isiolo. \\nHon. Mumina Bonaya (Isiolo County, JP): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I wish \\nto take this opportunity, first of all, to thank the Almighty Allah for his guidance and goodness \\nthat  has  seen  me  through  all  the  hurdles  in  my  journey  to  this  House  as  the  people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nrepresentative. I also wish, in a special way and with so much humility, to thank the people of \\nIsiolo for the honour, trust and confidence they conferred on me by resoundingly electing me \\nas  their  county  woman  Member  of  Parliament  against  all  odds.  Indeed,  Isiolo  people \\ndemonstrated the meaning of democracy in its truest form by electing me to the 13th Parliament, \\nin an election that was intensely contested and strongly characterised by, sadly, not real issues \\naffecting  ordinary  people  or  competencies  on  the  part  of  candidates  seeking  leadership \\npositions,  but  by  narratives  that  were  heavily  informed  by  tribal  and  clan  entitlements, \\nendorsements  and  formations  that  almost  destroyed  the  social  fabric  on  which  Isiolo \\ncommunities advance their well-being.  \\n\\nAs  their  representative,  I  proudly  stand  here  today  to  celebrate  the  resilience  and \\ndetermination that was shown by the ordinary people of Isiolo County in maintaining peace \\nand brotherhood in  their grand match to  the ballot,  where they  expressed their will through \\ntheir votes as the ultimate decision makers. On this day, I make a solemn promise not to let \\nthem down but to serve them diligently. \\n\\nI will now move on to matters which affect the people of Isiolo County, which is arid \\nand  semi-arid.  I  would  like  to  refer  to  the  Address  by  His  Excellency  the  President  on  the \\ndrought situation in our country and interventions that have been made by the Government so \\nfar. I wish to clearly state here that the situation on the ground has now moved from drought to \\nfamine.  People  are  now  dying  of  hunger.  There  is  no  water  for  both  human  and  livestock \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

We appreciate the food consignment that was flagged off by His Excellency the \\nPresident. However, I wish to state here that, looking at how the situation is evolving, more \\naction needs to be taken urgently so as to save both human lives and livelihoods. \\n\\nContinuous food relief is needed from now until five to six months after the rains. When \\nit rains, hunger persists up to when farmers harvest first and animals bounce back strongly. I \\nadvise that in future, food distribution should be guided by the number of households in a  \\nsub-location and the population in an area. I am saying this because I am sad to report to this \\nHouse that the consignment that was flagged off by His Excellency the President ended up at \\nhousehold level as just one kilogramme of rice and one kilogramme of beans. Looking at the \\nsituation  on  the  ground,  this  will  not  change  anything,  if  we  are  actually  serious  about \\naddressing the situation. \\n\\nOnce  again,  the  President  talked  about  climate  change.  He  pointed  out  climate \\nmitigation measures that include reducing greenhouse emissions to lessen the effects of climate \\nchange. While we appreciate that, what the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech missed out was the adaptation \\npart of climate change. As we all know, the effects of climate change are already upon us. We \\nmust find ways to cope with it. This needs to happen at both national and local levels. As a \\ncountry, we will continue experiencing the effects of climate change in the foreseeable future. \\nIt is important that we begin the journey on how we can cope with it. \\n\\nIn this regard, for effective adaptation to take place, as a country, we need to invest and \\nmake use of climate information in all our planning and development decisions. It is not right \\nthat we are always surprised by failed rains and the drought situation in our country. As such, \\nwe fail to act in good time to save lives and livelihoods. \\n\\nI am still debating on the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Address. I was saddened by the fact that he did \\ntouch on the security situation in my county and the entire Northern Kenya. For a very long \\ntime now, insecurity in Northern Kenya, and specifically in Isiolo County, has been a matter \\nof great concern. For example, Merti Sub-County has now become a battle field where militias \\nfrom  Wajir,  Marsabit  and  Samburu  East  walk  in  at  will,  kill,  maim  and  drive  off  herds  of \\nlivestock  belonging  to  the  locals,  with  so  much  impunity.  Lack  of  security  has  displaced \\nfamilies. Schools have closed down and Government services  are not  being rendered to  the \\npeople. Strategic water points and grazing areas like Mathasathen, Yamicha, Nyachis and Kom \\nhave been abandoned by locals. This makes Isiolo people more vulnerable to the biting drought \\nsituation as they now lack access to key resources that were once their drought fall-back areas. \\nA week hardly ends without an attack from these neighbours. Over the last three years, \\nwe buried a countless number of people with no trace and hope of recovering the herds of cattle \\nthat have been stolen. To put the matter into correct perspective, the pastoralists and their herds \\nof cattle in Isiolo County survive severe drought situations only to be killed and their herds of \\ncattle  stolen  by  militia  from  Wajir,  Marsabit,  Garissa  or  Samburu  East.  This  has  gone  on \\nunabated for far too long. As a matter of urgency, it is time the State moved in to look into the \\nunderlying  drivers  of  these  conflicts  with  the  intention  to  address  the  matter  decisively  and \\nrestore back respect for people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives and their properties, as guaranteed in our Constitution. \\nAs  I  conclude,  I  wish  to  make  an  appeal  to  the  Government,  Non-Governmental \\nOrganisations (NGOs), well-wishers and all Kenyans to remember the Kenyans who are now \\nstarving to death. We need to come together in the Kenyan spirit, like we have always done, to \\nsave the situation.  \\n   \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon.

I would like to thank them for electing \\nme despite the fact that I vied on a ticket of a party that faced a very hostile environment in that \\nregion. However, God was there and I am here. \\n\\nThirdly, I would like to congratulate and to note with thanks the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech. He \\nspoke with passion, commitment and the heart of a man who is ready to take up the challenge \\nof  leading  this  country  to  the  next  level.  The  President  reiterated  that  this  country  and  our \\ndemocracy have come of age. For the first time, we have six more women who were elected to \\nthis House. Therefore, we have increased their numbers. That gives us confidence that women \\nleadership is on the rise. This is exhibited even more by having a female Deputy Speaker in \\nthis House. This further reiterates the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sentiments. I look forward to having more \\nwomen leaders in this Parliament so that we can bridge the gender gap. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, if you look at the elections again, as noted by the President, this \\n  \\ntime we had 39 counties that voted for the President. That is up from 34 counties in the previous \\ngeneral election. What does this mean? This country is becoming more tolerant. Our democracy \\nis becoming more mature. Our democracy is taking shape given that we can now vote not based \\non our ethnicity but on ideas and national agenda. People can now cast their votes based on an \\nagenda put on the table. People in this country voted on an economic agenda. Everybody felt \\nthe economy was going down. Everybody understood that we had to have better ideas on the \\neconomy. Every voter knew that it was the economy that was hurting most of us. Therefore, \\nthey  went  to  the  ballot  and  voted  for  one  William  Samoei  Ruto  because  he  had  a  better \\neconomic agenda.  \\n\\nI would like to tell Kenyans that however tough the economic times are, we have better \\ndays ahead. These are just the pangs someone feels when giving birth but we are looking at a \\nbetter  Kenya  in  terms  of  the  economy.  I  want  to  assure  them  that  those  of  us  in  the  Kenya \\nKwanza Government will strive to make the economy better. We have the ideas, the minds and \\nthe people. You have seen for the first time a President who is not talking about anything else \\nbut the economy. He left the comfort of his office to go to where Safaricom and other players \\nwere together and he talked about Fuliza. Today you saw him at the National Stock Exchange \\n(NSE) talking about how to make the NSE available to everybody. He is a President who is \\nkeen on serving the country and changing the economic fortunes of this country.  \\n \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  this  country  cannot  move  forward  unless  and  until  we  are \\naccountable for the resources given to us. This Parliament must put its foot down to look at \\naccountability. We have had haemorrhage of resources. This country lost a lot of money in the \\npast  regime  through  corruption  and  dubious  projects  that  were  being  done  to  serve  other \\npeoples\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pockets and not this country. We had the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (KEMSA) \\nscandal  and  roads  that  are  being  built  at  a  cost  that  is  so  astronomical  that  even  baffles  the \\nengineers who designed them. Somebody sitting at a table is briefed by engineers that a road \\nwill cost us Kshs10 million but he says, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, make it Kshs30 million.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That is the amount of \\nmoney that we have spent and it is unnecessary. That is why I support the President when he \\nsays  that  we  can  comfortably  cut  the  Budget  of  this  country  by  Kshs300  billion.  We  can \\ncomfortably  do  that  because  many  projects  done  by  the  past  regime  have  had  exorbitant \\nunnecessary costs to them.  The costs were estimated not by engineers but because somebody \\nelse said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to make money out of this project. Therefore, increase the cost.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n \\nI  want  to  tell  Kenyans  that  this  Parliament  must  stand  firm.  Even  those  of  us  in  the \\nKenya Kwanza Government must stand firm to hold this government  accountable for every \\ncent that we give it so that Kenyans can have value for money.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker, one of the things I would like to speak about, which the President \\n \\ntouched on, is  about  having confidence in  our independent  institutions like the  Independent \\nElectoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and the Judiciary. Immediately after the court \\nruling, people started lambasting the Judiciary. Just because they lost a case, they want to make \\nthe  whole  world  believe  that  we  have  the  worst  Judiciary.  What  about  those  international \\nbusinessmen who are looking at coming into this country because they have confidence in the \\nJudiciary of this country? A time has come that when you lose a case, you dust your coat and \\ngo home. You say you have lost fairly instead of lambasting the Judiciary. The Judiciary has \\nhad a bad name just because one person lost a petition. The IEBC has been vilified just because \\nsomebody lost an election. \\n\\nFellow Members of Parliament, I would like us to build confidence in our institutions. \\nThat is the only way to move the democracy of this country forward. It is one of the things that \\nthe  President  noted.  More  importantly  is  that  this  country  needs  to  come  together.  The  last \\nelection pulled the ends of this country. It is time we brought this country together. The 13th \\nParliament could  be the organ to  bring this country together.  It  is one of the things that the \\nPresident  talked  about.  Fellow  Members,  it  is  time  we  preached  peace,  national  cohesion, \\ntogetherness and unity and brought this country together again so that the divide or the archaism \\nthat  has  been  brought  about  because  of  an  election  can  end.  We  should  bring  this  country \\ntogether, start working together as a nation, and build a cohesive country. That is the only way \\nwe can take this country forward.  \\n \\nAs I congratulate you, Hon. Deputy Speaker and the Hon. Speaker Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula, I would \\nalso want to thank the Kenya Kwanza brigade. I also thank the President for giving the Coastal \\nregion opportunity to have one of our own as the Speaker of the Senate. This is something that \\nis commendable. The people of the Coast know that this Government has taken care of their \\ninterests, for the first time. As we move forward, there are things that must be taken care of. \\nThe issue of water, especially in Kilifi and Ganze constituencies, is serious. I would like the \\nPresident to keep his promise\\xe2\\x80\\x94that he will build big dams there to ensure that the people of \\nKilifi do not die of hunger again. \\n \\nThe question of landlessness or squatters at the Coast needs to end in this Government. \\nAs I wind up my speech, I would like to ask fellow Members of Parliament some things. As \\nwe move together in the 13th Parliament, let us move on a bipartisan agenda and approach so \\nthat we can heal this country and move forward. God bless Kenya.  \\n\\nThank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Let us have the Member for Naivasha. The Member \\nfor Wajir will follow so that he does not  come up here. Then we will have the Member for \\nKericho, and so on. Most of you will have a chance.  \\n\\nThank you. \\n \\nHon.  Jayne  Kihara  (Naivasha,  UDA):  Thank  you  for  this  chance,  Hon.  Deputy \\nSpeaker.  I  will  make  my  contribution  short  because  my  kid  brothers  here  tell  me  that  their \\nconstituents are watching. They are on the television wanting to see them speak. I will make it \\nshort.  \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\nFirst  and  foremost  is  to  congratulate  you  on  your  election  as  the  Deputy  Speaker, \\ntogether with the Speaker. I know you are equal to the task. We have come a long way. We \\nhave done a lot of work for our party and President right from the season of wamama. I would \\nalso like to plead with our President to give positions to our fallen soldiers\\xe2\\x80\\x94the ladies who \\nwent round this country campaigning for this Government.  \\n \\nI wish to congratulate all the Members who found themselves in this House, whichever \\nroute they used to come to this place. We know it was rigorous and difficult. So, it is upon us \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I  applaud  Kenyans  for  the  way  they  conducted \\nthemselves during the elections. This is the most peaceful election that has happened in this \\ncountry in a long time. As leaders, we all owe it to Kenyans. We should applaud them because \\nof the way we did our politics. \\n \\nThe President spoke about the many things he is prepared for. What we know is that \\nwhat he said is what he means and this is what he wants to do for this country. This is what he \\nwent  round  promising  Kenyans.  We  know  he  is  a  sober  President,  hands-on  and  very \\nhardworking. We know this is going to happen.   \\n\\nI  also  wish  to  thank  him  for  giving  us  a  Cabinet  Secretary  from  Nakuru,  which  has \\nnever happened since Independence.  The First Parliament had Mark Mwithaga as an Assistant \\nMinister.  We have also had Mirugi Kariuki, Koigi Wamwere, Gitahi Ngaruro, Lee Kinyanjui \\nand myself, who have served as assistant ministers in previous Governments.  For once, we \\nhave a Cabinet Secretary, Zachary Njeru, and we thank the President for that. \\n \\nOn the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF), I was in \\nthe  pioneer  committee  when  the  relevant  law  was  passed,  which  was  sponsored  by  Eng. \\nMuriuki Karue.  I have also been a wife to a Member of Parliament who did not have the NG-\\nCDF.  This made me hate politics because I would see my husband sell cows and the whole \\namount would be donated to building classrooms or for development.  The NG-CDF is the best \\nthing that ever happened in this country.  It is upon all of us to support the NG-CDF, so that it \\nis aligned to the Constitution.  As I speak, the many students who we take to school through \\nthe NG-CDF that have been sent home. We have just come from  campaigns and we do not \\nhave anything to give to them when they come to us.  This is one of the things that we must \\nsupport. \\n \\nThe  President  talked  about  the  Competency  Based  Curriculum  (CBC).    The  CBC \\ntaskforce  is  very  important.    I  have  been  to  schools  and  found  mothers  knitting  for  their \\nchildren.  This makes one to wonder whose assignment that is.  Whose work will the teacher \\nmark for? The taskforce is important because we do not want to scrap off the CBC, but we \\nwant to get the best. \\n \\nOn drought in the country, many people have said that it should be declared a national \\ndisaster.  There are families that sleep without food.  As we wait for agricultural products and \\nfertiliser prices to be lowered, let us address the current drought situation. \\n \\nThe President also talked about the Universal Health Care (UHC).  I wish to thank the \\nPresident for nominating women to the Cabinet.  The current number of women in the Cabinet \\nis the highest we have had in this country. He had promised that 50 per cent of his Cabinet \\nwould be women. This did not happen, but at least, as women, we have got the biggest chunk \\nin his Government.  \\nI  wish  to  congratulate  the  single  constituency  women  Members.  This  is  the  greatest \\n \\nachievement.  In the 8th Parliament, we had eight women, which means there were only two \\nelected at the constituency level because the rest were nominated.  In the 9th Parliament, we \\nwere 18, with only 12 elected.  This time round, we are 29 women and we were 23 in the last \\nParliament.  We are catching up.  At this pace, you may find the gentlemen fighting for the \\none-third gender principle.  As women, we should work hard and give Kenyans the confidence \\nthat we can do better than our male colleagues.   \\n \\n\\nI support the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech. \\nHon. Ibrahim Saney (Wajir North, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. Every \\nspeaker before me has congratulated you and the Speaker for your election.  I know you have \\nbeen  inundated  with  so  many  congratulatory  messages.  I  wish  to  join  my  colleagues  in \\ncongratulating  you  for  your  election  as  the  Deputy  Speaker  and  the  Speaker  himself.    That \\nposition is well deserved. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

They elected me to \\nParliament in the 11th Parliament, sent me on leave in the 12th Parliament and they felt wise \\nthat I should be back to represent them in the 13th Parliament.  For that, I am grateful and I shall \\nremain indebted to them. \\n\\nFast-forward to the Presidential Speech, I am proud to have elected His Excellency the \\nPresident.  I come from an area that is majorly painter orange and red and it was not easy to \\nwin on a United Democratic Alliance ticket. It was not an easy battle to face seven Azimio La \\nUmoja-One Kenya Alliance candidates against one from Kenya Kwanza. Luckily, I triumphed.   \\n\\nThe President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Address was apt on the various issues facing the country.  Of concern \\nto me were issues of constitutionalism. His Excellency the President appointed the six judges \\nwho had gone through the due process in their recruitment, as was done by the Judicial Service \\nCommission. The only role left for the then President, His Excellency Uhuru Kenyatta, was to \\nappoint the six judges.  That was not done.  However, I am happy that the newly elected Fifth \\nPresident of Kenya has fidelity to the law and has appointed the six judges accordingly.  I am \\nalso happy that in his Address, he affirmed that the Judiciary Fund shall be operationalised. \\nThis is a great move towards constitutionalism. He also emphasised the fact that the Judiciary \\nshall cascade its services to the constituency level, taking justice to the people, so that they can \\nhandle the many cases by the locals at the grassroots, more so commercial and corruption cases.   \\n\\nI was taken aback when a previous speaker mentioned that the President did not address \\ncorruption issues.  Actually, the President made a bold undertaking that he would devolve the \\nJudiciary to the constituency level to ensure that commercial and corruption cases are expedited \\naccordingly.  This is the first time this is happening in the history of this republic. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the President has brought  hope to the rule of law by ensuring \\nthat the Inspector-General of Police is the accounting officer as espoused in the Constitution, \\nand that this is fully implemented. That was a bold move that we expected from him and he did \\nit in the first few days in office. \\n\\nThe other issue that the President addressed is that he implored the House to review the \\nStanding  Orders  so  that  we  can  have  the  Executive  on  the  Floor  of  this  House  for  us  to \\ninterrogate them on matters policy and service delivery. That is welcome, but we should be a \\nbit cautious on matters of separation of powers.   Separation of powers is  thin and it is  well \\nneeded.    We  must  not  confuse  different  arms  of  Government,  but  it  is  important  that  this \\nHouse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s previous position is restored to when the Question Time was the most interesting time \\nof debate in Parliament. \\n\\nFurther, the President talked about agriculture.  He emphasised that it is important to \\nhandle maters of production than the easy approaches to levies and subsidies.  I appreciate his \\nmove and I feel that it is the right way to go.  He spoke about agriculture from an expert oriented \\nposition. \\n\\nOn matters business environment, Kenya is the first, if not second, in Africa and the \\nworld, most unequal country.  The GDP is in the hands of 8,300 people only, according to the \\nlatest statistics from Oxfam. About 8,300 own 99 per cent of the GDP of this country.  The \\nPresident  emphasised  and  promised  that  he  would  improve  on  the  business  environment  to \\nmake sure that the inequality gap is reduced accordingly. \\n\\nFurther, he talked about the Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in regards to access to \\nwater.    He  promised  to  increase  access  to  water  from  60  per  cent  to  80  per  cent.  That  is  a \\nwelcome move. Water is a basic need, more so in the rural communities and in Arid and Semi-\\nArid  Lands  (ASALs).  In  as  much  as  I  appreciate  his  approach,  emphasis  is  given  to  either \\npublic or foreign investors who have the bigger muscle and what happens ordinarily is capital \\nflight. I would urge the President to consider small-scale investors so that they can also go into \\nthe partnership to sell and deliver water to earn money. Otherwise, the approach with regards \\nto the PPP is welcome and that brings me to the Bute Water Pan, which is a presidential flagship \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c11th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                 25 \\n\\nproject he has been following for the last ten years. I hope he will consider the Bute Water Pan \\nin Wajir as part of the PPP that he promised \\n\\nOn the UHC, the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) as it stands carries the name \\ninsurance, but  really does not  operate like an insurer.  It  comes under the regulation  and the \\nsupervision  of  the  Insurance  Regulatory  Authority  as  it  is  in  our  statutes,  but  every  year,  it \\nrequests for a waiver, so that it is not supervised like private insurance companies. That is to \\ntell  you  that  it  is  always  hiding  behind  the  name  insurance.  It  does  not  collect  premiums.  I \\nactually appreciate the approach the President has taken to overhaul the NHIF and rebrand it \\nto make sure it is a universal health care giver.  \\n\\nFinally, I can see the lights are on, but the President emphasised on drought, which is \\nravaging Wajir North and other ASALs areas. I think we need to reconsider and re-strategise \\non matters drought. We must bring on preparedness so that we can mitigate drought before it \\nstrikes. Otherwise, I appreciate and support the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech. Thank you, Hon Deputy \\nSpeaker. \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Thank  you,  Member  for  Wajir  North.  I  actually  took  you \\nseriously when you said that you wanted the time limited to five minutes. Obviously, it did not \\napply to you, maybe to the other Members.  \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\nI now call upon the Member for Kericho, Member 001 of the 13th Parliament. Kindly \\n\\nhelp her with the microphone. \\n. \\nHon. Beatrice Kemei (Kericho County, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for \\ngiving  me  this  opportunity.  First,  I  thank  God  for  enabling  all  of  us  to  be  here  and  most \\nimportantly, for the peaceful elections.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to congratulate you in a very special way for being \\nelected to that position. Receive greetings from the people of Kericho especially the women. \\nIn  the  12th  Parliament,  there  were  some  fracas  on  the  Floor  of  the  House  and  the  late  Hon. \\nLaboso had water poured on her. This time round, the women told me to be there for you, Hon. \\nDeputy Speaker, before anything of that nature happens. I will always wear flat shoes to enable \\nme swing to your defense. \\n\\nSecondly,  I  congratulate  the  Speaker,  who  is  a  seasoned  politician.  He  deserves  this \\nposition having risen through the ranks in Parliament for all the years. I would like to thank the \\npeople of Kericho County who gave me the opportunity to come to Parliament. This is a dream \\nthat I had for so many years. I remember when I was in Class Six, we had a debate between the \\npupils in Class Six and Class Seven, entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA teacher is better than a donkey driver\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. I was \\na proponent of the donkey driver. I was not eloquent, but I somehow represented my class and \\nwe won the debate. It was at that point that I appreciated my debating skills.  As I thank the \\npeople of Kericho, I must confess that being Member No. 001 in the 13th Parliament is no mean \\nfeat.  My  making  it  to  the  13th  Parliament  is  by  God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  grace  and  the  trust  by  my  people  of \\nKericho. I promise that I will work hard and discharge my duties diligently as per the oath that \\nI took to oversee, legislate and represent.  \\n\\nToday, being the International Day for the girl child, I believe the Speaker may have \\nknowingly or unknowingly allowed you the opportunity to preside over today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sitting. I pray \\nthat every girl child in this country enjoys this day.  I dedicate my speech to the many girls who \\nare in school, the women who are working hard to support their families and put food on the \\ntable, and those working in tea and coffee plantations, quarries and mama mbogas (grocers). \\nAs we celebrate the girl child today, I pray that we do not just support them materially, but \\nencourage them to be more innovative, creative and fight for their space.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I appreciate the President who upheld the two-third gender rule when it came to \\nthe appointment of the cabinet secretaries. He said he did his part and I believe this House will \\nuphold all the nominees for the positions. I congratulate Hon. Florence Bore, my predecessor. \\nI am here because she got another position, but I hope this House will uphold her position. \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  there  are  many  issues  facing  women  such  as  gender-based \\nviolence  (GBV).  We  have  cases  of  suicide  happening  around  the  country  particularly  in \\nKericho County. We have many stressed women in need of psychosocial support. I commit to \\nwork closely with the three arms of Government especially the Executive and the Legislative, \\nto ensure that women have their space. \\n\\nThe  President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Speech  was  just  the  best.  It  was  very  short,  but  full  of  wisdom.  He \\napplied what we call the mini skirt rule; long enough to cover the subject and short enough to \\nmaintain  interest.  At  the  end  of  the  Speech,  Members  were  very  excited.  He  gave  us  his \\nroadmap towards implementation of the bottom-up economic model approach. He highlighted \\nthe key steps in which the Government intends to use to achieve full realisation of his agenda. \\nAs I said, he appreciated the women leadership. \\n\\n Secondly, he talked about investing in agriculture by reducing the cost of production. \\nThis is very important and we will review the legislation that will moderate issues on export \\nand taxation of agricultural products. Agriculture is key in Kenya. This is the main area that \\ngives us economic empowerment. I pray that we put more emphasis on the same. We are not \\nonly concerned about food security, but economic empowerment. \\n\\nOn UHC, the President is concerned about a more effective, affordable and efficient \\nsystem.  In his  plan, he talked about  maternity  and the provision  of diapers for women with \\nchildren under three months. This made me think of getting one more child to appreciate the \\nGovernment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s program of free diapers for three months. I will come so that we can discuss and \\nI think you should join me. We appreciate the Government in supporting women by providing \\ndiapers  for  three  months.  That  will  help  our  women  who  have  children.  Our  health  is  our \\nwealth, and this will be good for us. \\n\\nOn the issue of housing, it is very important that we have the land, but more importantly, \\nwe should also have other enablers so that the housing programme can help many of our people.  \\nI see the lights are on, but I want to add one more point. Our people are waiting for the \\nHustler  Fund.  They  already  have  groups.  We  want  to  see  it  done  in  the  right  way.  The \\ndepartment at the Ministry that will take care of the Hustler Fund will have to do it well so that \\npeople do not miss out. Hustlers are waiting for it and they are ready to be helped. This will \\ncover everybody. It will help mama mboga, all the hawkers and everybody who is concerned \\nwith this. \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Member  for  Kwale  County?  Since  the  Member  for  Kwale \\nCounty is not here, we can have Member for Webuye East. Yes, honourable investor, Martin \\nWanyonyi, as the name says. Is that correct?  \\n\\nHon. Martin Wanyonyi (Webuye East, FORD-K): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, \\nfor giving me this opportunity. I am honoured to speak for the first time on the Floor of this \\nHouse on behalf of the people of Webuye East. I want to congratulate  you, Madam Deputy \\nSpeaker,  for  your  election.    I  also  want  to  congratulate  our  Speaker,  Hon.  Moses  Masika \\nWetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula, for his election as our Speaker in the 13th Parliament. \\n\\nI  also  want  to  congratulate  my  great  people  of  Webuye  East  for  the  trust  and  the \\nconfidence they bestowed upon me as their third Member of Parliament. I was born in a very \\nhumble, but a hardworking family, a family that trusted in my capability of being somebody \\nand also my possibility of pursuing my God-given dream. When I was born, I was blessed with \\ntwo  very  important  things.  One  of  those  things  that  I  was  blessed  with  is  this  condition  of \\nalbinism.

Even  on  the  face  of  the  system,  the  deep  State  and  the  Government \\nopposition, he was elected. I also want to congratulate and thank my Speaker because he led \\nthe team and the region that made the difference in who was elected President and who lost. I \\nwant to thank him for the support and for the relationship that he gave us.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, it is also said that to whom much is given, much is expected. I \\nwon in all the wards in my constituency. I am inheriting a constituency that is still very young, \\nthat has been in existence for only 10 years under the 2010 Constitution. My people are in need \\nof infrastructure. Schools are still not doing well, and many people lost their families and their \\nmarriages broke up because of the collapse of Pan Paper. I just want to promise them that my \\nexperience as a MCA - being nominated in 2013, elected in 2017, now elected as Member of \\nParliament - is a true testimony that I lead what Kenya Kwanza stands for. I am a true testimony \\nof  how  bottom-up  can  work.  Being  nominated,  elected  as  an  MCA  and  now  a  Member  of \\nParliament, I am sure the sky is the limit. Tutapanga maneno hapo mbele. \\n\\nI want to assure my people that we are going to do whatever we can. We are going to \\ngo out of our way to ensure that we realise every plan, every strategy and every manifesto that \\nwe promised them. I just want to ask them for their support and walk with me in this journey \\nso that we can transform our constituency together. \\n\\nFrom the outset, I just want to thank the President for his Speech. Through it, he was \\nable  to  demonstrate  that  he  does  not  believe  in  quantity,  but  in  quality,  preciseness  and  in \\nunequivocalness. This is why his Speech was precise, simple and to the point.  I want to also \\nthank the President because while the former President, Uhuru Kenyatta, believed so much in \\nbig  things  and  initiating  big  projects,  I  am  happy  with  the  current  President,  the  Kenya \\nKwanza's and the Fifth President.  I want to thank him because he believes in very simple and \\nfew things that are important  to  the Republic of Kenya and its citizens.  That  is  why in  the \\ninaugural Speech, he talked about universal healthcare and the transformation of agriculture. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members who are at the bench, your exchange with the \\nclerks is amounting to harassment as I can hear the conversation.  We still have three hours and \\neveryone who is on the list will get a chance to speak. You may proceed. \\n\\nHon. Martin Wanyonyi (Webuye East, FORD-K):  Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nI do not know whether they are doing that because I am the one speaking. I just want to continue \\nby saying that I thank the President for his Speech, his belief in very few, simple, but important \\nthings  to  the  Kenyan  people.    The  transformation  of  agriculture,  the  achievement  and \\nimplementation of the universal healthcare and the housing program are all being conceived \\nwithin Article 43 of our Constitution.  Article 43 on economic and social rights is so critical \\nand forms part of the centrality of our Constitution.  We have not done well in the last 10 years \\nin terms of actualising this particular Article in our Constitution.  I thank the President for his \\ncommitment to ensuring that Article 43 of our Constitution is achieved and is made alive and \\ntrue to the citizens of the Republic of Kenya.  \\n\\n I also thank the President for his Speech on the issue of having the cabinet secretaries \\nappear before Parliament and answer questions directly.  Concerns are raised by the Members, \\nbut we have a presidential system where we have never had absolute democracy.

Deputy Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Kitutu Chache South \\nHon.  Anthony  Kibagendi  (Kitutu  Chache  South,  ODM):  Thank  you  for  this \\nopportunity, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I first want to congratulate you and the Speaker for your \\nelection to the offices in the National Assembly.  I would also like to take this opportunity to \\ncongratulate all the Members, elected and nominated.  I take this opportunity to congratulate \\nthe  President  and  his  Deputy  on  their  election.    Mine  is  a  unique  story  of  sheer  resilience, \\ndetermination and relentlessness.  My story should inspire young people of this country that \\njust like Eliud Kipchoge says: ''No human is limited'', we should never give up. My political \\njourney started while in campus in 2007. I ran for elections in 2013. In 2017, I came close to \\nwinning. Without losing enthusiasm, in 2022, I got elected overwhelmingly by the people of \\nKitutu Chache South.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the wonderful people of Kitutu \\nChache South for electing me to serve them.  I thank team Kibagendi, those are the people who \\nwere running the campaign and I hope we will continue working together.   \\n\\nThe President gave a short and inspiring Speech. I particularly appreciate his focus that \\nhe wants to work towards, namely, lowering the cost of living and aligning the NG-CDF with \\nthe  Constitution  since  the  Fund  has  been  life-changing  especially  on  matters  to  do  with \\neducation and security in the countryside.   \\n\\nOn matters to do with the Credit Reference Bureau (CRB), I have been a victim of being \\ndenied a loan because of a small default I had with a mobile loan and that injured my standing \\nin society.  \\n  \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the President spoke very much about food security, agriculture \\nand various other issues like the universal health care. I want to confirm that Kitutu Chache \\nSouth is the only constituency in the larger Gusii region that has no inch of tarmac other than \\nthe highway going to Kisumu.  We are hoping that we will be considered this time round.  \\n\\nI wish to also appreciate the former Member of Parliament Hon. Richard Onyonka, and \\nthe Constituency Fund Manager, Mr. Kimutai, for the wonderful job they did.  We have great \\nprojects that have been done by the NG-CDF.   \\n\\nI wish the Member for Garissa Township stayed longer. He is an excellent debater and \\nI wish he could be with us.  He should have turned down the opportunity to serve as a Cabinet \\nSecretary and join us in the House, so that he can help us in checking the Executive because he \\ndoes a very good job.  Even today, he pushed our party chairman to buy a television and watch \\nhow His Excellency William Ruto will do his work. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I served as an advisor to our President while he was the Deputy \\nPresident and I have no doubt he will do a wonderful job with the opportunity that he has been \\ngiven.  I hope the opposition will be objective and focus on its role unlike what we witnessed \\nin the past five years where we did not seem to have a proper opposition that was checking the \\nexcesses  of  the  Executive.    I  hope  the  Executive  will  focus  on  its  mandate  and  not  open \\naggressive policies like we saw in the past where they failed to honour court orders.   \\n\\nFinally, I hope the President and his Cabinet will instil discipline especially in the Civil \\n\\nService.   \\n\\nI thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity. I again want to thank the people \\n\\nof Kitutu Chache South for allowing me to serve them.   \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, you will all get an opportunity. Be patient with \\n\\nthe clerks, we will get to you because we still have until 8.00 pm. Thank you. \\n\\nMember for Baringo County.   \\nHon. Jematiah Sergon  (Baringo County, UDA): Thank  you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nFrom the outset, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate you and Hon. Speaker for being \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I also want to congratulate our President, His Excellency Dr. William \\nSamoei Ruto, who is a man of his words. He is ready to serve and is a dedicated man of God \\ntoo.  I assure all of you that I will give him unconditional support going forward.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I was privileged to be part of Kenya Kwanza and now I am an \\nelected  Member.  I  also  participated  in  their  campaigns.  I  must  say  that  in  his  Speech,  the \\nPresident spoke rightfully about what we always talked about in our campaigns. For me, what \\nI captured most was the issue of social security.  \\n\\nAs you are aware, this country is heavily indebted by foreign debts. The President said \\nthat  as  a  country,  we  can  help  one  another  through  saving  and  borrow  from  our  savings  to \\ndevelop ourselves and the Government can also use this money for infrastructure and building \\nof  schools.  If  you  read  his  Speech,  he  clarified  that  social  security  in  Kenya  especially  the \\nNational Social Security Fund (NSSF) is so much undermined because of poor saving culture.  \\nHe encouraged all of us to save more. The format used now shows that the people who \\nare  keen  on  saving  are  the  ones  in  formal  employment  especially  Civil  Servants.  Many \\nKenyans, the young generations, those who never went to school, and those in the private sector \\nwork every day and hustle.  These people should be encouraged to save, so that we can have \\nan opportunity to develop this country. \\n \\nHe also talked about innovations through the present-day technology. I am very much \\naware that all of us, as Members of Parliament, are tech-savvy in one way or the other. We are \\nalways exposed to electronics. The President, through his Speech, encouraged us to be more \\ninnovative.  He  also  encouraged  the  young  generation  to  be  innovators  and  find  ways  of \\nmarketing  their  products.  They  should  do  as  much  as  possible  to  help  this  country  going \\nforward through technology because it is here with us forever.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, because of time, I want to reiterate that I was a bit disappointed \\nby the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech because he did not mention insecurity matters. I come from Baringo \\nand as a daughter of Baringo, I have witnessed and faced many problems because of insecurity.  \\nInsecurity in the Kerio Valley belt is mainly associated with cattle rustling and banditry \\nthat has destroyed the wealth of families.  People are becoming poor because this matter has \\nbeen there for ages, and has never been tackled and eradicated fully. I expected the President \\nto be keen and give direction because his Speech was on the State of the nation. As I speak, I \\nwant to tell the august House that banditry is one of the menaces that have claimed the lives of \\nKenyans, and police officers. These are people we have given opportunity to take care of our \\nlives and our property. \\n\\nA week before the President gave his Speech, we lost several policemen and women \\nand civilians through a raid that occurred in Lokori in Turkana. I will read their names because \\nunfortunately they were not mentioned by the President during his Speech in the House. You \\nmay  think  that  cattle  rustling  is  only  happening  in  Baringo,  but  it  is  affecting  everyone  in \\nKenya. The officers were William Karimi, Alex Wambua, John Kisoi, Boniface Mutiso, Edwin \\nOmari, Eric Rugut, Brian Macharia, and Augustine Ndiema. We also lost our dear sister, Mary \\nKanyaman, who was a biochemist, one of the learned daughters of the soil of Turkana. We also \\nhave others who were injured like Raphael Gituro and Peter Ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99ang\\xe2\\x80\\x99a. This is something that \\nwe cannot wish away. Going forward, as a Member of Parliament, I will bring Bills to help us \\neradicate this matter. Why am I so much affected by this? This is because I come from Baringo \\nwhere  we  are  adversely  affected  by  this  menace.  Banditry  is  manufactured  in  Tiaty \\nConstituency.  \\n\\nI am saying this because as the Member of Baringo County, I have the prerogative and \\nauthority to mention this on the Floor of the House, so that we can solve this problem right \\nfrom  the  source.  As  I  speak,  there  are  killings  and  displacement  of  people  and  innocent \\nchildren. I just came from Baringo on Saturday and we buried one gallant soldier, who was \\nserving as a General Service Unit (GSU) officer in Barwessa Ward.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c11th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                 30 \\n\\nThe issue is not about burying because of bandit killings, it is what we leave behind. \\nAs we buried the son of Kuikui in Barwessa, I watched his children and wife who is barely \\ntwenty something  years old. His son watched keenly with a sombre mood as his father was \\nbeing buried. He did  not  move and even when they were doing the gun salute, the boy just \\nstared at his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coffin. It is not about the bandits, but the people that are left behind. We \\nlack psychosocial support. The families are left poor and dejected. They do not know where \\nelse to go, especially those who are displaced and do not know what to do next. At the end of \\nthe day, it looks like it is business as usual for the Government and the country. People are \\nbeing killed and no one discusses it afterwards. We just go and bury them.  \\n\\nI want to urge this Parliament to, with the help of all Members here, kindly let us work \\nhard to enable other Kenyans, especially those in Baringo and Kerio Valley belt, to have the \\nsame peace as other people in this country.  \\n \\nbehalf of the people of Baringo alone, but for future generations.  \\n\\nI want to conclude by saying this is our world and Kenya today. I am not speaking on \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you, Member for Baringo. Let us have the Member for \\n\\n \\nKisumu Central. He is not here? Member for Starehe Constituency? Member for Mathare. \\n \\nHon. Anthony Oluoch (Mathare, ODM): Thank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nFrom the outset, allow me to join fellow Members who have congratulated you on your election \\nas Deputy Speaker. I have no doubt that you and Hon. Speaker, both distinguished lawyers and \\njurists, will take this House to heights higher than where you found it.  \\n \\nFrom  the  outset,  I  would  like  to  say  that  I  am  a  student  of  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  a \\nlawyer by profession. If I have turned out to be a poor or good lawyer, she would be responsible \\nfor it, but I am sure it is the latter. In my final year of school, I was among the top 10 students \\nwhom  she  took  to  Washington  DC  to  the  Philip  C.  Jessup  International  Law  Moot  Court \\nCompetition. I am happy that we did a good job under her leadership and stewardship.  \\n\\nI was in the 12th Parliament and saw the zeal and industry that she put in the committees \\nshe was in,  especially the Select  Committee on  Delegated  Legislation.  I  am  sure that if she \\ntranslates that zeal to the House, we will be so much the better. So, I congratulate you, Hon. \\nDeputy Speaker, as I also congratulate the Speaker.  \\n\\nThis is my second term, but it is my third attempt at being a Member of Parliament. \\nWay back in 2013 when I was still trying to cut my political teeth in the same constituency, \\nHon.  Speaker,  Moses  Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula,  was  gracious  enough  to  call  and  give  me  my  first  direct \\nticket as a member of the FORD-Kenya Party. I returned with 8,000 votes and I am eternally \\ngrateful for that opportunity.        \\n\\nI also thank the people of Mathare for electing me for a second time to represent them \\nin  a  very  diverse  constituency  -  one  that  is  the  face  of  Kenya.  If  you  come  to  Mathare \\nConstituency, you will find every conceivable tribe there. If you think you will be elected in \\nMathare  by  your  tribal  majority  or  numeracy,  you  will  be  shocked  because  if  I  were  to \\nbenchmark it against my tribe, I am actually third in terms of numerical numbers. I do not take \\nit for granted.  \\n\\nSecondly, there is a slang phrase they use in Mathare \\xe2\\x80\\x9chapa unanawa mara moja.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If \\nyou were to translate it, it simply means that  you wash  your hands once.  Every Member of \\nParliament before me served for only one term and exited. So, I thank them.  I will take my \\nwork seriously and diligently. We laid the foundation in the first term, and I will do everything \\npossible to ensure that the trust and confidence that they have bestowed upon me as the people \\nof Mathare shall not be disappointed.  \\n\\nLastly on that issue, before I go to the Speech, I thank my family for constantly and \\nsteadfastly standing behind me throughout the last campaigns and the previous ones. I thank \\nthem.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I wanted to paraphrase the skirt principle \\nthat was alluded to by the Member for Kericho. My law professor, another one, not the current \\nSpeaker, used to say that when you are faced with a question in an exam paper, a good answer \\nto a question is like a lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skirt. It is short enough to excite and long enough to cover the \\nsubstance.  Well,  the  jury  is  still  out  as  to  whether  the  President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Speech  excited  the  base \\nenough.  When  I  say  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbase\\xe2\\x80\\x9d,  I  mean  the  election  promises  that  were  made  under  the  Kenya \\nKwanza plan. The jury is still out, in my view, as to whether it was long enough to cover the \\nsubstance. Listening to a number of Members, quite some ground was covered, but there are \\nother issues that were not quite well-covered.  \\n\\nSecondly, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I wanted to speak to the issue of the tone. In my view, \\nthe tone of the Speech was moderate. This was an opportunity for the President to try and bring \\ntogether the more than 6.9 million Kenyans who still felt aggrieved, for one reason or the other, \\nand those who did not vote for him. However, to my disappointment, looking at Paragraph 11, \\nif I was to quickly glean through what the President said, it amounted to a trolling of his chief \\nopponent,  the Right  Hon. Raila Amollo Odinga.  In that  paragraph, he said that it is  only in \\nKenya  where  a  sitting  Deputy  President  becomes  the  candidate  of  the  opposition,  and  the \\nopposition  leader  becomes  the  candidate  of  the  Government,  and  that  the  candidate  of  the \\nopposition  becomes  the  President.  I  thought  that  was  an  opportunity  not  to  rub  salt  in  the \\nwounds  of  the  6.9  million  people  who  he  clearly  stated  at  his  inauguration  that  he  will  be \\nPresident of, whether they voted for him or not. I thought that that was an opportunity to try \\nand rally everybody together, both the seven million who voted for him, and those who did not.  \\nGoing forward, I hope presidential speeches will be corrected. These include the ones \\nthat I witnessed at the burial of the Deputy President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brother, where some of our Members \\nstill seemed to be in an election mood and were trying to pull back the President into rubbing \\nsalt in the wounds of the losers in a manner that suggested that while the people who lost have \\nmoved on and are trying to heal, the victors apparently seem to find pleasure in trying to bring \\nthose people back and rubbing salt in their wounds. Going forward, I hope the President will \\ncorrect that. \\n\\nThe  first  point  that  I  noted  that  I  want  to  speak  to  is  on  the  issue  of  oversight.  In \\nParagraph 16 of the Speech, the President indicated that he would try to ensure that institutions \\nwork, that Parliament provides oversight, and that members of the Cabinet are here to answer \\nQuestions as part of enhancing that oversight.  \\n\\nI would like to go back to Paragraph 11 and paraphrase it. He said that it was only in \\nKenya  where  we  have  a  sitting  deputy  elected  as  president,  the  opposition  leader  being  the \\ncandidate of the Government, and that opposition candidate being elected president. It is also \\ntrue that it is only in Kenya where an elected President, in his first 30 days, makes it his business \\nto implement one of the main campaign platforms and policies of the opposition leader. I thank \\nhim for this because when he says he wants to bring cabinet secretaries to Parliament, is that \\nnot the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) that was shot down by the current President and his \\nteam? This is an attempt at implementing piecemeal some of what we proposed in the BBI.  \\n\\n[The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Gladys Boss) left the Chair] \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n[The Speaker (Hon. Moses Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\n \\nI  also  want  to  speak  on  the  issue  of  the  independence  of  the  Judiciary.  I  was  in  the \\nDepartmental  Committee  on  Justice  and  Legal  Affairs  as  well  as  the  Select  Committee  on \\nImplementation of the Constitution in the last Parliament. I support the President in terms of \\nthe Judiciary Fund, which he promised would be put in place. I also thank him that within the \\nfirst few days, he swore in the judges who had not been sworn in. Those are good gestures, but \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Both  are  wrong.  If  the  Judiciary  gets  into  bed  with  the  Executive,  I  will  quote \\nAlexander Hamilton who once said in his Treatise of 1889 that, while the Executive holds the \\nsword and dispenses honours, and Parliament holds the purse-strings, the Judiciary dispenses \\njustice. That is the last vanguard; the last place where members of the public would go if they \\nwere offended. It would be a big disservice to Kenyans if the Judiciary, in an attempt to give \\nback to the Executive what it has extended to them, got into bed with it.  \\n \\n\\nI see that my time has run shorter than the 10 minutes that\\xe2\\x80\\xa6   \\nHon.  Speaker:  Your  time  is  up,  wakili.  Let  us  have  Hon.  Richard  Yegon  of  Bomet \\n \\nHon. Richard Yegon (Bomet East, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me \\nthis opportunity to make my Maiden Speech as United Democratic Alliance Party Member of \\nParliament for Bomet East Constituency. I wish to take this earliest opportunity to congratulate \\nyou on being  elected the Speaker of the National  Assembly.  I  also  congratulate the  Deputy \\nSpeaker, Hon. Boss Shollei, and my colleagues who made it to the 13th Parliament.  \\n\\nEast. \\n\\nIt has been a long and winding journey for me to be here having attempted twice to \\nsecure  the  party  ticket  for  the  final  run  in  vain. In  this  year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  UDA  party  primaries  and  the \\nsubsequent general election, God and the voters were on my side. In what I take as payback for \\nconsistency and persistence to offer leadership to the great constituency, to my immediate and \\nextended  family  members  and  friends  who  stood  by  me  through  a  very  difficult  time,  my \\ncampaign team that went an extra mile to deliver the win, I am for ever indebted to you. Many \\nthanks and respect go to the voters, the youth and the elderly, who woke up at dawn, braved \\nthe chill, the scorching sun and long queues to cast their votes. They waited for hours on end \\nas the votes were counted, tallied by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission \\n(IEBC) clerks and results finally announced by the Returning Officer. The voters believed in \\nmy cause and ensured that we won. I will not let you down. \\n\\nTo those who opposed my candidature and to my competitors, former area Member of \\nParliament,  the  Kenya  African  National  Union  (KANU)  Secretary-General,  Mr.  Nick  Salat, \\nDr. John Kalia of Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) Party, you were worthy competitors. We all \\nengaged in issue-based politics devoid of tricks and character assassination. True to all tenets \\nof multi-party democracy, the best candidate won. I wish to reiterate that it is time for us, the \\npeople,  to  tilt  the  coin  in  the  way  we  operate  in  identification  and  implementation  of \\ndevelopment projects for the benefit of the residents. I am looking forward to working with the \\nnational  and county  governments,  all stakeholders, donors and residents  in  finding a lasting \\nsolution to the socio-economic challenges facing the constituency. \\n\\nThere  is  little  footprint  of  development  projects  in  Bomet  East  Constituency  by  the \\nJubilee  administration  of  former  President  Uhuru  Kenyatta.  The  administration  can  only  be \\nremembered for the stalled upgrade to bitumen standard of the 75-kilometre Tenwek-Merigi-\\nTegat-Chemaner-Kimuchul-Mateja  and  the  Chemaner-Kembu-Longisa-Kipreres-Kaparuso-\\nKembu-Koibeyon-Mulot roads. Hardly one kilometre was constructed before funding of the \\nproject was withdrawn a year ago for what is believed to have been a move by the then powers \\nto punish the residents for their political affiliation.  \\n\\nI  am  confident  that  the  Kenya  Kwanza  Government,  through  the  able  leadership  of \\nPresident William Ruto, will prioritise completion of the projects which were starved of funds, \\nincluding the Longisa-Kipreres-Sigor Road whose tender was awarded, but construction is yet \\nto take off. Before being elected, it is on record that I was able to channel my own resources \\ntowards improving the 17-kilometre Tegat-Chemaner-Kembu Road in response to numerous \\nappeals from residents. This was only a stop-gap measure.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

We  should  prioritise  the  Mulot-Mengit-Toronik-Kipreres-\\nCheboin-Meregi-Kong\\xe2\\x80\\x99otit-Chepkitwal and Lekimbo-Cheboin-Chepkolon-Injerian roads.  \\n\\nDespite the fact that water is a key enabler of development, Bomet East, which is highly \\nagriculture-endowed,  has  eventually  been  faced  with  acute  shortage  of  the  precious \\ncommodity. Water shortage, for both domestic use and irrigation, affects all the five wards in \\nthe constituency, namely, Kembu, Merigi, Chemaner, Longisa and Kipreres. I wish to thank \\nthe African Development Bank (ADB) for funding the ongoing extension of water pipelines to \\nLongisa  and  Mulot  trading  centres  in  a  bid  to  ease  the  acute  shortage  of  the  precious \\ncommodity. As a long-term solution,  I appeal to  the national Government, under the Kenya \\nKwanza  Coalition,  to  fast-track  the  implementation  of  Kibusto  Water  Project  in  Chemaner \\nWard. The project, identified in early 1980s, has the potential of supplying water by gravity to \\na larger part of Bomet East Constituency and is highly cost effective. \\n\\nTo  spur  economic  growth  and  improve  people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  livelihoods,  I  will  be  engaging  the \\nnational  Government  to  connect  electricity  to  households  under  the  last-mile  connectivity \\nprogramme, even as we push for new lines to be rolled out.  \\n\\nI  am  glad  that  in  response  to  concerns  raised  by  the  people,  the  President  set  up  a \\ntaskforce to review the Competency-Based Curriculum education system, which will identify \\nschools to be made centres of excellence in the constituency so that we can rally donors on \\ntheir construction and equipping to accommodate bright but needy students.  \\n\\nWith agriculture being the driving engine of the Kenyan economy, it is noteworthy that \\ngrowing tea by small-scale farmers and dairy farming are the main sources of livelihood for \\nthe residents following the collapse of the maize sector due to the maize lethal necrosis disease \\nfor more than fifteen years, hence the negative impact on food security in the region. The uptake \\nof avocado farming on subsistence and commercial scales has steadily  risen in  the last four \\nyears. We will walk with the stakeholders to construct a pack house for farmers to sell their \\nproduce through export to fetch higher prices. The recent move by the Government to set up \\nan ICT centre in Mulot, specifically as a software development hub in the country, is highly \\nappreciated. It is a welcome move that will go a long way in demonstrating that there is a huge \\npotential for rural areas to drive Kenya\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industrial growth. We, men and women in the House, \\nlook up to you and the House leadership for guidance as we learn the ropes of legislation, which \\nis what voters have sent us here to do. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Thank you., Hon. Members. I know we can vote on reduction of time, \\nbut with consensus,  I see we have about 83 requests. Today is the last Allotted Day. If  you \\nagree, we can have five minutes per Member so that we can have as many of you as we possibly \\ncan to make your speeches on this Presidential Address. Is that agreeable? \\n\\nHon. Members: Yes. \\nHon. Speaker: Excellent. If you make your points in less than five minutes, you will \\nbe even more appreciated. Hon. Joseph Kahangara. If you can make it in less than five minutes, \\nyou are excellent. \\n\\n Hon.  Kahangara  Mburu  (Lari,  UDA):  Thank  you  very  much,  Hon.  Speaker,  for \\ngiving me this opportunity to contribute. I will try to make it as short as possible to enable other \\nMembers to make their contributions.  \\n\\nThis being my first time to speak in the 13th Parliament, I take this opportunity first to \\nthank the Almighty God for giving me favour among the people of Lari. They found me fit to \\nrepresent  them  in  the  13th  Parliament  for  the  second  time.  I  thank  the  people  of  Kinari, \\nNyanduma, Kamburu, Kijabe and Lari/Kirenga Wards who voted for me overwhelmingly on \\n9th August to be their Member of Parliament. \\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I will remain forever indebted to them for the work that they did for \\nme. \\n\\nAs I talk to the people of Lari, let me also take this opportunity to condemn the acts of \\narson that are taking place in our area. Two schools were burnt in as many weeks. I urge the \\nteachers and the schools\\xe2\\x80\\x99 administration to  work together to  ensure that  our schools remain \\nsafe. A lot of effort and resources are put together by parents to put up the schools. When they \\ngo up in smoke, it is very unfortunate.  \\n\\nI will now go to the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Address. Our Kenya Kwanza Coalition Candidate, His \\nExcellency the President, went round this country, into every corner and county, and collected \\nviews from  Kenyans. He asked them what  they  would  expect  him to  do when he forms  the \\nGovernment. He came up with what we called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This is what he explained in his \\nspeech here. He explained what he would do for Kenyans. \\n\\nLet  me just pick out  a few issues that affect  my people in  Lari.  I  come from  a rural \\nconstituency where over 90 per cent of my people depend on agriculture. His Excellency the \\nPresident talked about value addition. Whenever we produce excess products, most of them go \\nto waste because the market is saturated. The President talked about value addition. This means \\nthat  we  can  keep  our  products  longer,  export  the  same,  earn  more  money  and  create \\nemployment for our people.  \\n\\nThe other main challenge that we face in agriculture is that, sometimes, we are unable \\nto get our products into the market because of poor infrastructure. It is my hope that the current \\nGovernment will take up the ongoing projects, especially the Mau Mau roads, and ensure that \\nthey are completed. The Government should also come up with more road projects, so that our \\npeople can get their produce to the markets. \\n\\nOn  the  same  agriculture,  the  President  talked  about  the  reduction  of  the  price  of \\nfertilizer from Kshs6,500 to Kshs3,500. We have already seen that some of that product has \\nbeen taken to the people. However, the people of Kiambu County only have a store in Thika \\nTown  where  we  have  the  National  Cereals  and  Produce  Board  (NCPB).  People  from  Lari \\ncannot go there. We ask the Government of Kiambu County to devolve the same, so that the \\nproduct can be taken to every sub-county.  \\n\\nAmong  other  things,  the  President  spoke  on  the  issue  of  National  Government-\\nConstituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF). As another Member has said, people are now \\nasking for bursary which we do not have. He said that he served as a Member when there was \\nNG-CDF and when it was not there, and he knows what it means. We are happy because we \\nnow have goodwill from the Executive. Let us get NG-CDF back, so that we can serve our \\npeople better. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Thank you, Mheshimiwa. Woman Representative for Mombasa. \\nHon.  Zamzam  Mohammed  (Mombasa  CWR,  ODM):  Ahsante  sana,  Mhe.  Spika. \\nNaitwa  Mhe.  Zamzam  Chimba  Mohammed.  Ningependa  kuchukua  fursa  hii  kuwashukuru \\nwakaazi wa Mombasa ambao walinipa kura zao kwa heshima na taadhima. Nawapongeza sana. \\nPia, nampongeza pia Kinara  wangu wa Chama,  kiongozi  wangu, Mhe. Raila Amolo \\nOdinga,  kwa  kuamini  wanawake  na  kutupa  nafasi  mwafaka.  Mwisho,  pia  tulikuwa  hatujui \\ntushike wapi lakini, alitusaidia tukafunga kazi na kupata ushindi. \\n\\nNingependa pia kushukuru familia  yangu  yote ambayo ilinishika na kuniombea dua. \\nNawaambia wakaazi wa Mombasa kuwa nitawafanyia kazi. Nitahakikisha kuwa mtoto wa kike \\natapewa heshima katika jamii, na atapata nafasi ya pili ya kupata elimu na kuondoa tamaduni \\nambazo ni potofu.  \\n\\nKatika  Hotuba  ya  Rais,  ningependa  kwanza  kumpongeza  sana  kwa  kuturejeshea \\nbandari yetu ya Mombasa. Lakini pia, nina wasiwasi kwa kuwa tetesi zimetoka nyingi kuwa \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Ningependa  kumwambia  Mtukufu  Rais  kuwa,  kwa  hisani \\nyake, heshima na taadhima, afuatilie jambo hili ili wakaazi wa Mombasa wasiwe wakutolewa \\nkafara na bandari yetu ichukuliwe. Wakenya wote wachangie jambo hili. Tuchange pesa hizi \\ntunazodaiwa na Mchina ili zilipwe na Wakenya wote. \\n\\nNingependa pia kumwambia Rais kuwa tuna maliasili na rasilimali zetu, kama wakaazi \\nwa  Pwani,  kama  vile  korosho  na  madini.  Ningependa  kumshawishi  na  kumuelezea  kuwa \\naturahisishie barabara ya Dongo Kundu iweze kufunguliwa mapema, ili tuweze kupata ajira na \\nkufungua viwanda ambavyo vitaleta ajira kwa vijana wetu wa Mombasa. Wengi wamepotea \\nkatika  mihadarati.  Wengine  wanachukuliwa  na  ushawishi  mkubwa  kwenye  mambo  ya  Al-\\nShabaab, kwa sababu ya ukosefu wa ajira. \\n\\nKwa hivyo, namuomba Rais pia atufungulie viwanda. Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) \\nilikufa  Mombasa,  lakini  inafanya  kazi  sehemu  zingine.  Haijafufuliwa  Mombasa.  Tuangalie \\nviwanda vya korosho, miwa na Kenya Bixa. Vyote vifunguliwe ili wakaazi wa Mombasa na \\nPwani nzima waweze kupata ajira na kuuza rasilimali zao. \\n\\nNataka  kuzungumzia  mambo  ya  afya.  Sote  tunaelewa  kuwa  National  Hospital \\nInsurance Fund (NHIF) ililetwa ili kuboresha na kufanya wepesi wa watu kupata huduma za \\nafya. Lakini, wengi wakienda kwenye hospitali, wanaambiwa kuwa NHIF inagharamia pesa \\nya  kitanda  na  hakuna  dawa  na  huduma  zingine  ambazo  wanafanyiwa.  Wazee  wengi \\nwamelalamika sana. Kwa hivyo, Serikali iangalie hali katika NHIF, ili tuweze kupata huduma \\nambayo inatibu maradhi mengi mazito.  \\n\\nKisha  nikiangalia  mgao  wetu  wa  National  Government  Affirmative  Action  Fund \\n(NGAAF) kama akina mama wa kaunti 47, mgao wetu uko chini sana ukilinganisha na kuwa \\ntunafanya siasa kaunti nzima. Ndio maana wengi hawarudi Bungeni. Kwa hivyo, namuomba \\nRais,  aangalie  hilo  kila  atakapoangalia  National  Government  Constituencies  Development \\nFund  (NG-CDF)  na  yale  mengine  ya  kaunti.  Pia,  sisi  wanawake  katika  The  National \\nGovernment Affirmative Action Fund (NGAF), namuomba aangalie hali zetu ili tupate mgao \\nambao utatusaidia.  \\nNikirudi  upande  wa  migration,  watoto  wetu  wa  Pwani  na  hasa  Waislamu \\n \\nwanahangaishwa sana katika kila pembe. Kupata kitambulisho cha Kenya imekuwa ni donda \\nndugu. Wanaulizwa mpaka birth certificate za vilembwe na vilembwekeza wakati ambapo wao \\nni watoto waliozaliwa Kenya. Wamezaliwa katika hospitali zetu na wanajulikana. Ningeomba \\nRais  aangalie  hilo  hasa  kuhusu  sisi  Waislamu  ili  tusipate  matatizo  tunapotafuta  pasipoti  na \\nvitambulisho.  \\nHon. Speaker: Thank you, Mheshimiwa. Let us have the Member for Kitutu Masaba. \\n \\n \\nHon. Clive Gisairo (Kitutu Masaba, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. I congratulate \\nyou on your election as Speaker of this House. I thank the people of Kitutu Masaba for electing \\nme  to  be  their  representative  in  this  13th  Parliament.  Hon.  Speaker,  I  will  go  straight  to  the \\nPresident\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech. I will look into the matters that mainly touch on my people. \\n\\nWith  regard  to  agriculture,  the  President  and  the  new  administration  has  released \\ncheaper  fertilizers  than  the  ones  that  have  been  availed  in  previous  months.  This,  however, \\ndoes not favour all citizens of this country because not every farmer grows crops. Personally, \\nI am a poultry keeper. The cost of feeds in this country is simply unaffordable. It is no longer \\ncheap  to  keep  any  animal.  Therefore,  we  get  very  stiff  competition  from  imported  goods, \\nespecially  animal  products.  We  urge  the  new  administration  to  consider  animal  feeds  while \\nlooking at agricultural inputs. \\n \\nWhen we talk about infrastructure in this country, there is no balance. Infrastructure \\ndoes not only relate to Nairobi and the surrounding environs. I come from a constituency where \\nroad  coverage  is  at  a  dismal  level.  We  urge  this  new  Government  to  ensure  that  there  is  a \\nbalance and that, all the citizens and the people of Kitutu Masaba have their roads done and \\nfeel part of this nation. For example, we have two contracts in my constituency - the RWC586, \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

That contract also \\ncovers  Gekano-Girango-Moturumesi  and  Manga-Motemumwamu.  You  will  be  surprised  to \\nknow that with 67 per cent of the time covered for that contract, only five per cent of the work \\nhas  been  done  and  yet,  my  people  are  suffering  and  nobody  addresses  this  issue.  We  have \\nanother contract, RWC485, Kemera-Kiendege-Gachuba-Keumbu. This contract is 37 months \\nbehind schedule. There is neither a contractor nor equipment on site and yet, my people expect \\nto feel like part of this country. \\nOn  the  President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Speech,  there  was  not  much  that  was  touching  on  education. \\n \\nEducation is the equaliser of all of us. I am a son of a watchman and I am here today because \\nof  education.  We  need  to  put  more  effort  and  resources  into  Technical  and  Vocational \\nEducation Training (TVET) colleges and polytechnics so that our youths can have a place to \\nlearn handicraft and any other skills that can help them be of importance to this country. As we \\nhave a country of hustlers led by the chief hustler himself, we need to get more skills for our \\nyouths so that they can fit in the society.  \\nOn the Uwezo Fund and the Hustler Fund, these should be looked into so that they are \\n \\ncomplemented or merged. We do not need too many funds and duplications that end up not \\nserving the intended goal.  \\n \\nOn the NSSF, whoever put that paragraph in the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech should be called to \\norder. It was a very casual statement whereby it was said it is 200 x 12 x 30 and yet, NSSF is \\na Fund where trustees are earning millions of shillings which they are meant to invest for the \\npeople. We should not be discussing the change of the contribution in this House. Instead, we \\nshould discuss the management of NSSF and people put to task to ensure that they deliver their \\nresponsibilities to the people of Kenya. \\n \\nyears in this House. \\n \\n \\nopportunity to contribute and make my maiden speech. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Thank you, Hon. Member. Member for Bura. \\nHon.  Yakub  Adow  (Bura,  UPIA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker,  for  giving  me  this \\n\\nI thank the people of my constituency. I look forward to serving you in the next five \\n\\nI take this earliest opportunity to thank God almighty for giving me the opportunity to \\nrepresent the great people of Bura Constituency in this 13th Parliament. Secondly, I thank my \\nparents, my family and my dear wife who really prayed for me and supported me throughout \\nthis journey. Thirdly, I thank my employers; the great people of Bura Constituency, who have \\nshown confidence in me by giving me a landslide win against all other opponents. My great \\npeople  of  Bura  Constituency,  I  really  assure  you  that  I  will  serve  you  with  purpose  and \\ndedication. I will ensure that you get what  you intended to  get when  you elected me to this \\naugust  House.  I  specifically  thank  my  teams  in  Bangale  Ward,  Madogo  Ward,  Sala  Ward, \\nChewele Ward and Hirimani Ward for the dedication they had.  \\n \\nFast forward, indeed, it is a dream comes true for me to be contributing today in this \\naugust House. My election to this august House is a true testament that no human is limited \\nand all dreams are valid. If you dream and pursue your dreams with dedication and purpose, \\nyou will achieve. My employers have sent me here to use all avenues and premiums available \\nto air their concerns and grievances.   \\n \\nBecause  I  have  only  five  minutes,  let  me  rush  through  the  challenges  within  my \\nconstituency. The biggest challenge is the drought that is facing all the arid and semi-arid lands. \\nIn Bangale Ward today, a 20-litre jerrycan of water goes for Kshs80. If you quickly do your \\nmaths, this vital commodity is Kshs4 per litre. We do water trucking from as far as Garissa that \\nis 90 kilometres away from Bangale Ward. Today, I am happy to report that I got a well-wisher \\nwho helped me with a 35,000-litre capacity water truck. This will be of great help to the people \\nof Bangale Ward and Sale Ward which are the worst hit areas. I urge the Government, through \\nthe Ministry of Water, to come in handy and help alleviate this problem. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

As  we  know,  this  is  a  very  important \\n \\ndocument. There is a student who secured a scholarship to pursue further studies in Turkey but \\nis unable to travel because of lack of that vital document. \\n\\nLastly,  I  want  to  highlight  the  issue  of  education.  We  have  13  secondary  schools  in \\nBura Constituency - 10 public schools and three private ones. The sorry state of affairs is that \\nin the last Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination, the best school got \\na mean grade of D (plain), and this is a private school.   \\n\\nHon. Speaker, because of time,  I  wish to  request the new administration  to  help  my \\nconstituency and to help farmers in my constituency so that, at least, we can help with food \\nsecurity. That is in line with the agenda of the Government. \\n\\nThank you. \\nHon. Speaker:  Thank you. Women Representative for Tharaka Nithi.  Give her the \\n\\nmicrophone. \\n\\nHon.  Susan  Ngugi  (Tharaka  Nithi  CWR,  TSP):  Thank  you  Hon.  Speaker.  I  am \\ndelighted as I make my maiden speech and debate a little about the Presidential Speech that \\nwas made about two weeks ago.  I wish to congratulate you for having been elected Speaker in \\nthis 13th Parliament. \\n\\nIt is a great honour as I stand in this House as the second woman representative or rather \\nthe Member of Parliament (MP) for Tharaka Nithi County.  I first wish to thank the people of \\nTharaka Nithi County for bestowing on me strength to lead them in the affirmative action.  It \\nwas not easy being lifted from a Member of County Assembly (MCA) to an MP; being lifted \\nfrom a County Assembly to a National Parliament; and, winning against all the strides and tides \\nhaving been elected in a non-dominating party.  I also wish to thank my party leader of The \\nService Party (TSP) whom I deputise, Hon. Mwangi Kiunjuri, for holding my hand and helping \\nme clinch the victory. \\n\\nI am here to affirm to the people of Tharaka Nithi County that I have not come here to \\nmake a career, but to make a difference in their lives. I have not come here to act in my own \\ninterest, but the interest of the people of Tharaka Nithi County. I wish to affirm to them that I \\nwill really hold hands with the MPs; that is, MP for Tharaka Hon. George Gitonga Murugara, \\nMP for Maara Hon. Kareke Mbiuki and MP for Chuka/Igambang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ombe Hon. Patrick Munene, \\nto  ensure  that  we  promote  the  issues  of  Tharaka  Nithi  County,  especially  the  issues  of  the \\naffirmative action. \\n\\nI  know  Tharaka  Nithi  County  has  really  been  marginalised  and  has  faced  a  lot  of \\nhistorical injustices, but with the leadership of Kenya Kwanza Alliance under his Excellency \\nWilliam Samoei Ruto, we are assured that all these issues are going to be addressed.  This has \\nreally been demonstrated by the fact  that our President has gone to  the most remote part of \\nTharaka Nithi County, Tharaka Constituency, and to the most remote part of Tharaka, Irunduni \\nvillage, where he has nominated a Cabinet Secretary for Interior and Coordination of National \\nGovernment, Prof. Kithure Kindiki.  I wish to congratulate him and pray that this House will \\nvery  soon  move  ahead  and  confirm  Prof.  Kithure  Kindiki  as  the  Cabinet  Secretary.  Hon. \\nSpeaker, we are  really hopeful that it is  just a matter of time that someone from  the soil of \\nTharaka Nithi County is going to rule this country.   \\n\\nI cannot end my maiden speech without commending my predecessor, Hon. Beatrice \\nNkatha, for having been elected twice  as Women Representative for Tharaka Nithi County.  \\nUnited Democratic Alliance (UDA) Party and the Kenya Kwanza Alliance are well aware of \\nthe role that Hon. Nkatha played in spearheading the campaigns for UDA party.  In this regard, \\nI pray that UDA and Kenya Kwanza Alliance will recognize the efforts by Hon. Nkatha. I also \\nwish her well in all her endeavours. \\n\\nAs  pertains  the  President's  Speech,  it  was  brief  and  to  the  point.  The  Speech  has \\nreassured us that we are not to tear apart institutions but to nourish them; and that, we are to \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I wish to end it with a note: That the future of this nation does not belong \\nto the faint-hearted, but to the brave. \\n\\nI thank you Hon. Speaker and this House.  \\nHon. Speaker: Thank you Mheshimiwa.  Member for Rabai.  Rabai not Aldai.  Your \\n\\nturn will come. \\n\\nHon.  Kenga  Mupe  (Rabai,  PAA)  Ahsante  sana  Mhe.  Spika  kwa  kunipatia  fursa  hii \\nnitoe maoni yangu.  Kwanza nashukuru Mwenyezi Mungu kwa umbali ambao amenifikisha. \\nLeo niko hapa katika Bunge letu tukufu.  Naomba nichukue fursa hii ya kipekee kuwashukuru \\nwakaazi wote wa eneo bunge la Rabai kwa kusimama nami. Siku ya kupiga kura walijitokeza \\nkwa wingi kunichagua niwe mtumishi wao.   \\n\\nNataka kuchukua fursa hii kupongeza timu yote ya Kenga Mupe a.k.a Apewe, kutoka \\nMwawesa Ward, Ruruma, Kambe/Ribe na Rabai Kisurutini. Kwa hakika, walifanya kazi  ya \\nmaana  tena  nzuri.  Mimi  kama  mtumishi  wao,  Mhe.  Anthony  Kenga  Mupe,  nawahakikishia \\nwakaazi  wote  wa  Rabai  kuwa  nitawatumikia  pasipo  ubaguzi  na  pasipo  kuangalia  yule \\naliyenipigia kura na yule ambaye hakunipigia kura. \\n\\nMhe. Spika, kuhusu Hotuba ya Rais, ilikuwa safi sana, fupi, nzuri, na ya kuaminika.  \\nKwa  sababu  katika  Hotuba  hiyo,  alizungumzia  suala  la  maji.  Kama  tunavyojua,  Katiba  Ya \\nKenya katika Ibara 43(1)(d), inamhakikishia kila mtu haki ya kupata maji safi, salama na ya \\nkutosha. Kwa hivyo, nampongeza sana Mhe. Rais kwa hotuba yake iliyoangazia suala la maji.  \\nNikiwa Mbunge wa Rabai, najua tatizo kubwa sana ni ukosefu wa maji. Kwa hivyo, kupitia \\nHotuba ya Mhe. Rais, sekta ya umma na ya kibinafsi zitasambaza maji kwa Wakenya wote.  \\nNapongeza sana Hotuba ya Mhe. Rais.   \\n\\nPia katika Hotuba ya Mhe. Rais, alizungumzia Hustler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fund.  Kupitia Hustler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fund, \\nvijana wetu watapata nafasi ya kufanya biashara ndogo ndogo. Mama mboga, mama fagio na \\nmama kuuza nazi kutoka Rabai atapata nafasi nzuri ya kujiinua katika maisha.  Kwa hivyo, \\nnapongeza kikamilifu Hotuba ya Mhe. Rais na ninaiunga mkono kwa sababu imezungumzia \\nzile shida za mtu wa chini hususan kutoka Rabai Sub County. \\n\\nNikimalizia, nakushuru Mhe. Spika. Wewe ni kiongozi wa chama cha FORD Kenya na \\nalama yako ni Simba. Ingawa hivyo, juzi wakati ulipokuwa unatoa mwongozo na uamuzi humu \\nBungeni kuhusu ni nani wengi katika Bunge hili, kwa hakika ulisimama imara kama simba na \\nkuamua kwamba Kenya Kwanza ndiyo ina wabunge wengi katika Bunge hili. Ahsante sana \\nMheshimiwa Spika. Nakupongeza wewe na Naibu wako. Mungu aibariki Kenya. \\n \\nHon. Speaker: Ahsante Mheshimiwa. Anayefuata ni Mbunge wa Aldai.  \\n \\nHon. Marianne Kitany (Aldai, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker for giving me this \\nopportunity  to  make  my  maiden  speech.  I  promise  to  make  it  short  and  sweet,  just  like  the \\nPresident\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech.  \\n\\nFirst, let me congratulate you and the Hon. Deputy Speaker for your election to those \\npositions in this House. Let me also congratulate the President for his election. Already, within \\nthe  30  days,  he  has  done  so  much.  Hon.  Mbadi  mentioned  that  the  President  has  not  done \\nanything in the 30 days, but we know that the President has done so much. For instance, the \\nSafaricom Fuliza interest rate has been reduced by 40 per cent. That is no mean feat.  It has \\ngone a long way in helping the Kenyan mwananchi to get credit at a cheaper rate. We also have \\nseen him engage in many international activities in which he is getting many accolades and \\nbeing saluted by leaders, including the President of the United States of America. So, who are \\nwe not to appreciate the work that he has done? \\n \\nthe Opposition.  \\n \\n\\nThe work that he has done in 30 days is very meaningful, but it is being undermined by \\n\\n[The Speaker (Hon.

(Ms.) Boss Shollei ) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\nHe is trying to sort out the problems and messes that were created in the last 10 years. He has \\nfive years to deliver and we are sure that he will deliver. To the people of Aldai, I would like \\nthank you very much for having faith in me and electing me. You have done your bit and mine \\nis to deliver.  \\n \\nI have a four-point agenda for the people of Aldai. The first one is road infrastructure. \\nIn  the  10  years  that  the  annuity  program  was  put  in  place,  Aldai  Constituency  got  zero \\nkilometres of tarmac road. I would like to use the opportunity I have in this House to ensure \\nthat Aldai gets, at least, some tarmacked roads in the next five years. \\n\\nThe second agenda item is electricity. Many homes still lack electricity. I think we have \\n\\n30 per cent connectivity in Aldai. We hope to have many more homes getting connected.  \\n\\nThe third agenda item is water. I am happy that the President, in his Speech, mentioned \\nthat water projects will be done on the basis of Public Private Partnership (PPP). So, we will \\nget water to our homesteads.  \\n\\nFinally, it is  on education. We have a big shortage of teachers in  various schools in \\nAldai and, hence, the poor performance in schools. We hope that the Ministry of Education \\nwill send in more teachers. Kenya Kwanza promised to employ 160,000 teachers in the first \\nand  second  year  each.  We  hope  that  out  of  those  teachers,  majority  of  them  will  go  to  our \\nschools to improve teaching standards. \\n \\nOn NG-CDF, we are happy that the President recognises that it has done a lot in our \\nconstituencies.  I  will  ensure  that  the  NG-CDF  is  used  to  improve  the  infrastructure  in  our \\nschools. More than 25 schools in my constituency are still mud-walled in this day and age. I \\nhope to ensure that by the time I am done with my term; there will be no mud-walled schools \\nin Aldai Constituency. I will give priority to the 25 schools that are still mud-walled. The NG-\\nCDF has been very successful. We hope that other Government development projects will be \\nchannelled through the same framework as the NG-CDF. Just like the way Kenya Rural Roads \\nAuthority (KeRRA) has been functioning, we hope that other Government entities will do their \\nprojects in constituencies so that each and every constituency gets a pie of  the development \\nprojects. There is a school in my constituency that went on strike, but  I hope that it will be \\nsorted out. \\n\\nFinally, on the issue of Competency Based Curriculum (CBC), we want to \\xe2\\x80\\xa6    \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Kesses. \\n \\nHon. Julius Rutto (Kesses, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. Let me also take \\nthis opportunity to join my colleagues to congratulate you and Hon. Speaker for being given \\nthe opportunity to serve this Honourable House. I thank my constituents of Kesses that saw an \\nopportunity to have me sit in this House and prosecute matters that touch on their livelihoods. \\nI believe that all of you know that whenever you mention Kesses, of course, something comes \\nto your mind. It was not that simple, but I thank God that I made it to this House. \\n\\nThe President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech is one that was delivered in a very short time and yet, it carries \\n\\nweighty matters that touch on Kenyans. The President said and I quote: \\n\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have news, and not very good news!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\n\\nIndeed, this was a Speech that was made with openness, without fear and without hiding \\nany issues that touch on Kenyans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lives. It is a matter of fact that we must admit even in this \\nHouse; that Kenyans are facing very difficult times now. The cost of living is on the higher \\nside. The debts that have been soiling our Kenyan economy are a reality. This Speech brings \\nall  our  minds  together  to  appreciate  that  we  have  a  big  role  in  this  House  to  support  the \\nGovernment in transforming our economic lives of our people, so as to have a Kenya that we \\ndreamt  to  have.  Kenyans  at  the  lower  base  shall  enjoy  the  dream  of  being  citizens  of  this \\ncountry. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker, on the aspect of healthcare, I want to confirm to this House that \\n \\nwe have and are facing a lot of challenges as Kenyans right now. Over the weekend, I managed \\nto attend two different funerals where families had lost their loved ones as a result of cancer, \\nwhich is now ravaging families in the countryside. It is, indeed, an issue that we need to look \\ninto in this House. Do we need to legislate laws that are going to enable the National Health \\nInsurance Fund (NHIF) to specifically take care of all those illnesses, especially the terminals \\nones?  This  is  because,  whenever  they  affect  our  families,  they  bring  down  our  economic \\nabilities.  \\n \\nSecondly, it is about enabling the bottom-up economic model, which the President used \\nas his campaign tool. On the aspect of education, I come from a county that entirely depends \\non  education  and  agriculture.  In  the  higher  education  sector,  there  have  lately  been  a  many \\ncases where our universities are ageing and collapsing. I am privileged to have Moi University \\nin my constituency. Right now, it requires serious attention from the national Government to \\nrevolutionise and re-organize it so that it can retain its glory of producing the human capital we \\nrequire.  \\n \\nOn the aspect of Hustler Fund in Paragraph 28, I want to appreciate the President for \\nrecognising that we have a working nation and that Kenyans are very resilient. The challenges \\nwe  are  facing  at  the  moment  is  access  to  cheap  capital  and  funding  that  can  fund  their \\ninnovation. This is something we need to put together as a House of legislation and support the \\nPresident.  I  believe  that  the  incoming  Cabinet  Secretary,  Hon.  Chelugui,  will  consider  this \\nmatter because Paragraph 28 is talking about the use of technology that will ensure that fund \\nis  managed well.  I want  to  believe  that he is going to  consider giving an opportunity to  the \\nyouth of this nation, especially those who can innovate in technology, to be the example of \\nappreciating the bottom-up economic model. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, lastly, I wish to appreciate the President for nominating to the Cabinet \\nsome Hon. Members of Parliament who have sat in this House before. These are the people \\nwho resonate well with people on ground and understand where the real issues are. I wish to \\ncongratulate them and tell them that time is on their side to prove that; indeed, we can articulate \\nand prosecute matters that target the lives of Kenyans.  \\n\\nThank you and may God bless you. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Karachuonyo. \\nHon. Adipo Okuome (Karachuonyo, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I am \\nhappy for this opportunity. I have really waited. When I spoke to the Hon. Speaker, he told me \\nto wait, which I have done. I wish to congratulate you and the Hon. Speaker for having been \\nelected to your positions. I wish to thank my constituents, the Karachuonyo people, for electing \\nme the second time to the 13th Parliament.  \\n\\nI want to refer to the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, and, in particular, on the cost of living. When \\nhe  removed  the  subsidy  on  fuel,  it  really  meant  that  the  cost  of  living  had  to  go  up.  As  we \\nspeak,  the  cost  of  living  has  gone  up  quite  high  and  the  fuel  is  reaching  a  level  of \\nunaffordability. It is the policy on subsidy production rather than consumption which may not \\nwork for Kenyans. For example, if you take the fuel which is imported, the production part is \\ndone in a country outside Kenya and, therefore, the policy of subsidising productivity cannot \\napply.  That  is  because  we  cannot  afford  to  give  subsidy  to  a  country  outside  ours.  This  is \\nsomething that should be considered because when fuel price go up, it gives rise to prices of \\nalmost every commodity.  \\n\\nThe one thing that I think the President ought to have mentioned - but he very much \\navoided  it  -  is  corruption.  Much  of  our  money  goes  there.  When  the  President  says  that  he \\nwants to reduce the budget of Kshs3.3 trillion by Kshs0.3 trillion, he is trying to make ends \\nmeet. Reduction of a budget does not help anything because it depends on what the budget was \\nmeant to do. If you reduce it by Kshs300 billion, that money was supposed to do something for \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

How is he going to fund that deficit? This is something that needs to be considered. \\nOtherwise, we are going to have a problem. Maybe, he should have gained that Kshs300 billion \\nby reducing corruption at a much higher figure than the figure that he wants to reduce with. \\n\\nThe President visited my own county and I thank him very much for that. Some people \\nhave criticized us, we the elected leaders, that we did not join the President during his visit. Let \\nme say it here and now that the criticism is not justified at all. We did not join the President \\nbecause we did not even know that he was going to Homa Bay County. Therefore, saying that \\nwe avoided being with him there is just trying to criticize us for nothing. I want this to go on \\nrecord because that is a very important thing. We do not want a negative reflection where we \\nare not concerned. Of course, the President has a right to visit any place, anywhere at his own \\ntime either in the company of politicians or alone. He exercised his right. Why bring us into \\nthat problem that we did not want to be with him? No! That was not right. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, my time is over. Thank you for giving me the opportunity. I am \\n\\nhappy for it. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Moyale. Proceed. \\nHon. (Prof.)  Guyo  Jaldesa  (Moyale, UPIA): Thank  you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for \\ngiving  me  this  opportunity.  As  everybody  else  is  doing,  may  I  also  take  my  chance  to \\ncongratulate you and the Hon. Speaker for your election to lead this House. I also thank the \\ngreat people of Moyale for giving me an opportunity to serve them in this august House. I also \\nthank  the  people  of  Kenya  for  accepting  to  remain  cohesive  and  peaceful  during  the \\nuncomfortable election period.  \\n\\nAs the President said, the election was intensively contested and both sides had almost \\nequal numbers. There is another 8 million people who did not vote. If they had voted, we do \\nnot  know  which  side  they  would  have  voted  for.  However,  the  people  of  Kenya  remained \\nobedient and loyal to the law. Even the order of the leadership in this House was disputed and \\nsomehow settled in a very acrimonious way. There was no clear winner and that is why there \\nwas that contest. Africans like to refer to leadership as being God-given, and it is a choice. As \\nleaders in this House, inside and outside here, we need to embrace humanity and try to bring \\nthe nation together. \\n\\nOn the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, I am happy that the President talked about Universal Health \\nCoverage (UHC). This is a good thing, but I am of the opinion that we need to find out how to \\nmake  National  Health  Insurance  Fund  (NHIF)  cover  a  universal  thing  that  every  Kenyan  is \\nentitled to. Our neighbour, Rwanda, has 98 per cent NHIF coverage. There is no reason we \\ncannot do it. \\n\\nThere is also need for us to achieve that universal coverage to restructure the Ministry \\nof Health. The Health Ministry was devolved, but that devolution has actually disadvantaged \\nareas that were already disadvantaged. There is no reason why a doctor should not be moved \\nfrom Kisumu to work in Garissa and vice versa. This business of putting people in counties \\nactually restricts the movement of people and deployment of staff and, therefore, disadvantages \\nareas which are already disadvantaged. It is my view that health facilities at the level of 4, 5 \\nand 6 should be put under the national Government and levels 3 and 2 put under the county \\ngovernments. \\n\\nPeople  said  the  President  gave  a  short  Speech.  It  was  not  short!  It  was  actually  33 \\nminutes of oral presentation. Somebody can cover a wide area at that time. I listened carefully \\nto the issues of drought and insecurity in the country. Most Members have contributed to the \\nissue of insecurity. Just  a few days before the Address  by  His Excellency  the President,  11 \\npolice officers were killed in Turkana. Last week, a police officer was killed. The Government \\nof Kenya should take positive action to ensure that those tribal clashes, clashes between the \\npolice and clan clashes come to an end. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy  Speaker,  as  I  conclude,  let  me  talk  about  drought.  The  lives  and \\nlivelihoods of people from the North matters. We need to take positive steps to make sure that \\nour lives are protected from recurring droughts. We should take measures to make sure that \\nothers do not die unnecessarily from the effects of drought every season.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Murang\\xe2\\x80\\x99a County. \\nHon. Betty Maina (Murang\\xe2\\x80\\x99a CWR, UDA)]: Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. My \\nname is Betty Njeri Maina. I wish to first thank the Almighty God for giving me an opportunity \\nto be elected as a Member of Parliament for Murang\\xe2\\x80\\x99a County. I also wish to thank the people \\nof  Murang\\xe2\\x80\\x99a  County  for  electing  me  overwhelmingly,  being  a  youth  and  a  lady.  I  wish  to \\ncongratulate the Hon. Speaker for having been elected as the Speaker of this 13th Parliament. I \\nalso wish to congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for being elected as Deputy Speaker, \\nbeing a female Deputy Speaker from the popular caucus of the Women Representatives that \\nused to be unpopular and were referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflower girls\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. It shows that this House is coming \\nof age and we are moving forward. I wish to congratulate the President for having nominated \\nHon.  Alice  Wahome  to  be  the  Cabinet  Secretary  in  the  Ministry  of  Water,  Sanitation  and \\nIrrigation. She is  from Murang\\xe2\\x80\\x99a County and  I  wish to  confirm  to the nation that Murang\\xe2\\x80\\x99a \\nCounty is a hub for beautiful and brilliant women. We are sure that given the opportunity by \\nthis House, she will take water and sanitation matters to the next level.  \\n\\nI  wish  to  comment  on  the  President's  Speech.  Firstly,  70  per  cent  of  the  people  of \\nMurang\\xe2\\x80\\x99a County depend on agriculture. When we unlock agriculture, we are going to unlock \\nthe potential and the economy of the people of Murang\\xe2\\x80\\x99a County. I wish to pick a few points \\nthat the President talked about. He talked of reducing the cost of production on animal feeds \\nand farm inputs. I will not emphasise agricultural issues because Members have commented \\non them.  \\n\\nI wish to go straight to the hustler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fund. As we talk about the hustler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fund, I wish to \\nappreciate the existence of other funds, including the Women Enterprise Development Fund, \\nthe Youth Enterprise Development Fund and the Uwezo Fund. People may not have felt the \\nimpact  of those funds previously but,  if those funds are distributed in  the right  manner, our \\npeople are going to feel their positive effects. \\n\\nWe have hustlers and young women in this nation who are suffering. They are going to \\nother countries in search for greener pastures, especially our ladies who go to work in countries \\nlike Saudi Arabia. If we empower those people, we are going to mitigate some of those issues. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, if we continue empowering the hustlers, we are going to mitigate \\nthe issues of migration. Our young ladies are migrating from Kenya to other nations and  are \\nbeing misused and being made captives.  \\n\\nAs I summarise, I wish to go back to the issue of agriculture. If we work on agriculture, \\nwe are going to mitigate rural-urban migration and promote urban-rural migration. By doing \\nthis, we are going to create employment. We are also going to deal with the issue of housing \\nand this will eradicate slums and congestion in our cities. \\n\\nI am looking forward to working in this Parliament, to be mentored, to be guided and \\n\\nto take the people of Murang\\xe2\\x80\\x99a County to the next level. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: That was brief, concise and good. Member for Marakwet. \\nHon. Timothy Kipchumba (Marakwet West, Independent): Thank you, Hon. Deputy \\nSpeaker. My name is Kipchumba, the Member of Parliament for Marakwet West. Thank you \\nfor giving me this opportunity to make these remarks.  \\n\\nOne, I wish to thank the people of Marakwet West for electing me. I was elected under \\nextremely exceptional circumstances. I allegedly lost the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) \\nnomination and I went back to the ballot as an independent candidate. The people of Marakwet \\nWest  elected  me  overwhelmingly  through  the  independent  ticket.  I  want  to  thank  them  so \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I wish to  thank the people of Arror Ward, Kapsowar Ward, Moiben Kuserwo Ward, \\nLelan Ward, Cherangany/Chebororwa Ward and the people of Sengwer Ward for electing me \\nto this House. I came to this House when I was very young. I came to this House in the year \\n1996 when I was in Class IV in Kamasat Primary School. When I came at that time, it painted \\na picture and I told myself that one day, I will be in this House. I thank God because, indeed, \\ntoday, I am in this House. \\n\\n Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  in  so  far  as  the  Presidential  Address  is  concerned,  this  time \\n\\naround, we have an exceptional President. \\n\\nIf  you  read  the  book,  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMan  of  The  People\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  by  Chinua  Achebe,  there  is  a  character \\nknown as Chief Nanga, who was described as a \\xe2\\x80\\x98man of the people.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I think His Excellency the \\nPresident fits  that definition. He is  truly a man of the people.  I believe that  when he settles \\ndown to work, we shall have a President of the people, by the people for the people.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, what touched me in the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech was his commitment \\nto the rule of law. For me, that is a cardinal principle that this country must be ruled upon. We \\nmust be a country that abides by the rule of law. I want to commend him because the first thing \\nhe did was to appoint the six judges who were held in abeyance by the other regime. I think \\nthat was a hallmark of obedience to the rule of law. \\n\\nThe President also committed that he would implement bottom-up scaling of justice. I \\ncome from  a constituency where we have one court  of law serving four constituencies. The \\ncourt is  located in  Iten.  In Marakwet West,  we have no court, Marakwet  East  has no court. \\nKeiyo North and Keiyo South are only served by one court in Iten. Hon. Deputy Speaker, going \\nforward, I believe that we shall have many courts at the local level. \\n\\nI also want to comment on an issue that the President said, that he would implore upon \\nthis House to amend the Standing Orders so that the Cabinet Secretaries (CSs) appear on the \\nFloor of the House so that they can be asked Questions. I am inclined to the school of thought \\nthat, as per the current constitutional dispensation, the CSs may not appear on the Floor of this \\nHouse because the architecture of our Constitution is that one of a presidential system. That \\nwill  call  for  a  re-look  into  our  constitutional  architecture  so  that  the  CSs  can  appear  on  the \\nFloor of this House. \\n\\nOn the issue of National Government - Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF), I \\npersonally think that without NG-CDF, there is nothing much that the Members of the National \\nAssembly can achieve. Since we have the goodwill of the President, it will be good if the same \\nis  entrenched  in  the  Constitution.  Just  like  other  funds,  CDF  should  be  entrenched  in  the \\nConstitution. \\n\\nOn  security  matters,  he  never  touched  on  it.  But  I  have  confidence  that  the  security \\n\\nalong Kerio Valley Belt shall be dealt with accordingly by this Government. \\n\\nFinally,  I  want  to  thank  the  President  for  appointing  our  Senator,  Kipchumba \\nMurkomen, to be the CS for the Ministry of Roads, Transport and Infrastructure. Thank you so \\nmuch, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Nominated Member from Garissa, Hon. Harun. \\nHon.  Umulkher  Harun  (Nominated,  ODM):  Thank  you,  so  much,  Hon.  Deputy \\nSpeaker, for giving me this opportunity. My name is Hon. Umulkher Harun and it is with great \\nhonour and responsibility that I am able to serve in this 13th Parliament. I appreciate my party, \\nOrange  Democratic  Movement  (ODM),  for  believing  in  my  capacity  and  allowing  me  to \\nrepresent the interests of young people in this country. I also want to congratulate all Members \\nwho were elected and nominated from different political parties and wish them well as they \\ndischarge their mandate.  \\n\\nPresident William Samoei Ruto in his inaugural session in this House outlined various \\nissues  which  his  administration  would  wish  to  undertake.  One  fundamental  issue  His \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c11th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                 44 \\n\\nExcellency touched on is immediate consideration of the current drought afflicting our people \\nin the northern parts of our country.  \\n\\nI urge the President to work closely with the Pastoralist Parliamentary Group (PPG) so \\nas to address the immediate needs as well as stable long-term solutions. Arid and Semi-Arid \\nLands (ASAL) regions make up 89 per cent of land cover in this country. I would like to let \\nthe House know that the best lemons and watermelons come from Garissa County and northern \\nKenya at large.  \\n\\nOn the hustlers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fund, it is my belief that the President will actualise his pledge to the \\nyouth who I represent in this House. I urge him to ensure the fund is immediately available to \\nthis Kenyans on affordable interest rates, so, they can either expand or start their businesses. \\nOn Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), a country like Kenya is not having food shortage \\nbecause it cannot produce enough. The food shortage is largely because we are not producing \\nfor subsistence use but for international markets whose economic policy does not favour the \\nproducers especially in the third world countries.  \\n\\nKenya  does  not  need  GMOs  to  tackle  food  security.  What  we  need  are  policies  and \\nuniversally  available  food  preservation  methods.  We  lose  a  lot  of  food  to  wastage  due  to \\nrejection by international exporters.  Using the drought as a reason to allow GMOs in Kenya \\nwithout ensuring all the safeguards are in place is wrong. For example, Kenya has not ratified \\nthe Nagoya \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol to Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.  \\n\\nThe  protocol  provides  international  rules  and  procedures  in  the  field  of  liability  and \\nredress relating to living modified organisms. The protocol requires that response measures are \\ntaken in the event of damages resulting from the living modified organisms or where there is \\nsufficient likelihood that damage will result if timely response measures are not taken.  \\n\\nMy question then is: How do we open ourselves to this biotechnology without proper \\nprotection on measures in the name of food security? Instead, why not build dams and dispatch \\nirrigation  technologies  to  address  the  food  security  challenge?  We  should  invest  in  organic \\nfoods instead of going to GMOs. We have plenty of arable land that if irrigated, we can feed \\nourselves and export food. It is interesting to note that when North Eastern Province counties \\nare short of food, farmers in Molo are feeding fresh produce to their animals due to lack of \\nmarket.  \\n\\nGMOs  will  have  adverse  effect  on  organic  farming.  My  question  is:  Has  the \\nGovernment  consulted  the  public?  Was  there  any  form  of  public  participation  before  this \\ndecision  was  made?  How  can  the  Government  arbitrarily  make  such  decisions  while  being \\nsubservient to foreign interest? The decision has regional implications. For example, Tanzania \\nhas already braced itself for the possibility of our GMOs finding their way in the country. This \\nwill  affect  the  harmony  of  freedom  between  neighbouring  states  of  the  East  African \\nCommunity (EAC).  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity.  I  look  forward  to \\n\\nrepresenting the interests of young people in this House. Thank you very much. \\n\\nHon.

He talked about the hustlers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fund. I want to inform this House that the main concern \\nwe have in this country is access to credit. Our country has been having this problem for so \\nlong. It is important that our President thought it right to have the fund accessible to the people \\nwho cannot afford services like bank loans so that they can improve their lives.  \\n\\nI want to thank my party leader for mentoring, trusting and giving me a ticket which I \\nhad to deliver. Therefore, today, I am here representing the people of Trans Nzoia. I also wish \\nto urge the men in the House, as we deliberate on the amounts to be given to the hustlers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fund, \\nwe should also deliberate on the amounts given to women representatives through the National \\nGovernment Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF).  \\n\\nThe amount we have been given is very little, bearing in mind that we are representing \\nthe women, youth and people living with disability. They are most vulnerable in our country \\nand highly populous. I urge you as we discuss on the disbursement of funds to the hustlers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\nfund, let us increase funds given to NGAAF so we can give the women, youth and people living \\nwith  disability  in  this  country  services  that  will  serve  them  well.  I  know  if  we  empower  a \\nwoman, we will have empowered the whole community.  \\n\\nThank you, so much, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this chance.   \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Loima. \\nHon. Protus Akujah (Loima, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for allowing \\nme to add my voice to the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech. For the record, my name is Hon. Protus Akujah, \\nMember  of  Parliament  for  Loima  Constituency  in  Turkana  County.  Before  I  make  my \\ncomments  on  the  President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Speech,  allow  me  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  great \\npeople of Loima Constituency for recognising my commitment to work for them. Therefore, \\nthey have given me another chance to serve them and I do not take it for granted.  \\n\\nAccording  to  me,  the  President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Speech  was  concise  and  elaborate.  However,  I  am \\nquick to mention that I noted with utmost concern that he did not address the issue of insecurity \\nas mentioned by a Member from Baringo County.   \\n\\nI  know  there  could  be  some  relative  peace  in  some  parts  of  this  country.  But \\noutstandingly, the external aggression Kenyans continue to face from Uganda, South Sudan \\nand Ethiopia to the people of Turkana County is very loud. The Kenya Government has been \\nsilent  on  the  daily  killing  of  Turkana  pastoralists  in  Lokichogio,  Lotere,  Lorugum,  Loyoro, \\nKibish  and  Todonyang,  leave  alone  the  internal  insecurity  within  our  country  or  inter-\\nboundaries which has been happening in the form of livestock theft commonly known as cattle \\nrustling.  \\n\\nThis longstanding threat has caused many losses of lives, destruction of property, loss \\nof livelihoods, displacement of people and closure of social amenities such as health centres \\nand schools among others and yet the Government has been quiet. \\n\\n  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  I  urge  the  Government  to  bring  to  an  end  this  barbaric  and \\nbackward activity which for a long time has been commercialised. The cartels planning this \\nare on the loose and nobody is apprehending them. \\n\\nThe Government should deploy security forces including the National Police Reserves \\nalong our borders to check the run-away insecurity in these areas. There is need to have proper \\ncommunication  networks  along  these  problematic  borders  for  efficient  reporting  of  any \\ninsecurity  incidents.  Some  of  these  areas  do  not  have  Safaricom  or  Telkom  networks  and, \\ntherefore, atrocities are done to our people and there is no means to report to any government \\nforces. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

First, is  the completion of Lodwar-Lorugum-\\nLoya-Nayopwang  Road  to  ease  movement  of  people,  goods  and  services.  Second,  is  the \\nconstruction and operationalisation of Lokiriama Border Post to promote trade between Kenya \\nand Uganda and ease movement of people, goods and services.  \\n\\nThird, is the completion of Lodwar High Court which stalled in 2015. This will help \\nscale up justice and adjudicate cases efficiently. Since this court stalled, cases are now referred \\nto Kitale which is expensive for the Government and the people who have to travel to Kitale to \\nget justice.  \\n\\nLast, but not the least, is on the up scaling of agriculture productivity. Indeed, Kenya is \\nan agricultural country and the sector contributes 20 per cent to the GDP, and employs about \\n40 per cent of the total population. The sector also provides employment to 70 per cent of the \\nrural  population.  Scaling  up  this  productivity,  therefore,  requires  sufficient  budget  that  will \\ndeliberately put our farmers into farming activities to produce more. \\n\\nAn Hon. Member: (Off-record) Point of order! \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Member, I will not allow your point order. You should \\npress  the  intervention  button  which  you  have  repeatedly  not  done.  Instead,  you  have  been \\nshouting from your seat.  I call upon the Member for Tana River County to contribute. \\n\\nHon. (Ms.) Amina Abdullahi (Tana River County, KANU):  Thank you very much, \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity.  \\n\\nTo begin, let me congratulate you on your election as the Deputy Speaker to the 13th \\nParliament.  We believe that you will preside over the business of this House without fear nor \\nfavor.  \\n I wish to also convey my heartfelt gratitude to the people of Tana River County for having \\ngiven me the mandate to be their Women Representative. For those of us who have been elected \\nfrom the far-flung counties, we fully understand the enormity of the responsibilities placed on \\nour shoulders by our people who constantly brave the extreme drought, insecurity and untold \\npoverty. Therefore, our debut in the 13th Parliament is not, in itself, the change that we seek for \\nour people. It is only an opportunity to make that change. \\n\\n In this regard, I wish to emphasise the sentiments made by my colleagues, especially \\nthose  who  hail  from  arid  and  semi-arid  areas,  in  particular  Tana  River  County,  which  is \\ngrappling with severe drought. It is disheartening that in this age and era, our women have to \\nhit the road under the scorching heat and cover tens of kilometres in search of water.  \\n\\nIn  his  Address  to  the  Joint  Sitting  of  Parliament,  the  President  announced  that  the \\nGovernment had embarked on distribution of relief food to drought-stricken areas. While we \\nwelcome  this  move,  I  urge  the  relevant  Government  institutions,  including  the  County \\nGovernment of Tana River, to ensure that relief food reaches everyone facing drought across \\nthe  County,  especially  areas  of  Wayu,  Hirimani,  Assa,  Kone  and  Bangale,  which  are  really \\nfacing severe drought.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  the  President  also  spoke  robustly  about  incentives  through \\nfertiliser-subsidy  programmes \\nfertiliser-subsidy  programmes.in  agricultural \\nproduction  These  subsidy  programmes  will  drive  up  production  for  those  engaging  in  crop \\nfarming such as maize.  \\n\\nthrough \\n\\nI challenge the Government to ensure that livestock farmers are also given the premium \\nthey deserve. Pastoralists significantly contribute to the GDP of this country but end up being \\noverlooked or even accorded cosmetic policy intervention. As a daughter of a pastoralist who \\nrepresents  the  people  of  Tana  River  in  this  House,  I  bear  sacred  responsibility  to  devise \\nmechanisms and collaborate with the Government to escalate extensive services to livestock \\nfarmers, increase purchase of livestock products such as beef, and invest in value addition of \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The  value  chain  will  provide \\nemployment to our people and increase their thresholds.  \\n\\nLastly,  despite  being  elected  on  a  KANU  ticket,  it  is  worth  noting  that  Tana  River \\nCounty contributed to the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s victory and is among the 39 counties that provided 25 \\nper  cent,  actually  44  per  cent  of  the  votes  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  the  legal  threshold  which  won  the  presidency. \\nHowever,  during  his  announcement  of  Cabinet  Secretaries,  none  came  from  Tana  River \\nCounty. I also urge the President to kindly consider the people of Tana River by appointing \\nthem as Principal Secretaries, Administrative Secretaries and heads of parastatals.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.    \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Let us have the Member for Mandera.   \\nHon. (Ms.) Umul Kheri Kassim (Mandera County, UDM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy \\nSpeaker, for the opportunity. I take this opportunity to congratulate you for your election as the \\nDeputy Speaker of this august House. I thank the people of the great County of Mandera who \\noverwhelmingly elected me. I cannot take that for granted. I thank the few that did not vote for \\nme as well. I assure them that I will represent them well and ensure that services are delivered \\nto them. \\n\\n I  also  thank  the  leadership  of  Kenya  Kwanza  who  saw  it  fit  to  nominate  me  to  the \\nHouse Business Committee. As you know, HBC is a crucial committee that handles business \\nthat  comes  to  this  House.  I  want  to  tell  Members  that  I  will  ensure  that  business  will  be \\nprioritised and on time, God willing. \\n\\nTurning to the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech, it was generally good, precise and to the point. The \\npoint that caught my eye is when the President spoke about the youth. As you know, the youth \\nare an integral part of this society. He said that he is going to tap their potential and nurture \\nthem in whatever they are good at. The Ksh50 billion Hustler Fund is meant for hustlers. When \\nwe talk about hustlers, we mean women, youth, persons with disabilities (PWDs), the widowed \\nand orphans. As the county woman Member of Parliament for Mandera, and on behalf of all \\ncounty  women  Members,  the  amount  allocated  to  us  is  very  little  and  cannot  make  much \\nimpact. I wish to urge the President to allocate us some amount from the Hustler Fund so that \\nwe serve our people well. He expressed his good will on the NG-CDF. We wish that he also \\nconsiders our Fund. \\n\\nThe other point that has been echoed by many of my colleagues is the biting drought. I \\nhope and pray that it does not escalate into famine. Unfortunately, Members of Parliament have \\nnot been included on the task force formed by the Deputy President to manage response to the \\ndrought. The notice says that we will be appearing before the task force on a need basis. We \\nare the people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s representatives. We have been elected by the people to represent them. This is \\nwhen they need us most. I wish and hope that the leadership of the country will think about \\nthat. \\n\\nThe  other  point  is  the  insecurity  ravaging  pastoral  communities.  For  the  last  three \\nweeks,  we  have  been  seeing  in  news  what  is  happening  in  Baringo,  Marsabit  and  Turkana. \\nMilitia and bandits are wreaking havoc and killing young, promising, gallant soldiers. In North \\nEastern, there are inter-county sporadic clan clashes because of border issues and conflicts over \\nwater and pasture. Inter-county, intra-county, inter-clan and intra-clan conflicts are issues close \\nto our hearts, but the President did not speak about insecurity. But I know the President has the \\ngoodwill. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Mogotio. \\nHon. Kiborek Reuben (Mogotio, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I take this \\nmoment to thank the great people of Mogotio and our Almighty God for enabling me to be \\nhere. The great people of Mogotio from Kisanana, Mogotio and Emining wards have special \\nplace in my heart for entrusting me with the leadership mantle. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

To those who \\nare saying the speech was short, one of the greatest speeches ever delivered to mankind was \\ndone in 1960 by JF Kennedy. The speech lasted 13 minutes. However, Hon. Deputy Speaker, \\nup to date, we still remember the contents like: Ask not what your country can do for you but \\nask what you can do for your country. \\n\\nThe President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech talked about agriculture which is the main pillar and can change \\nthe economy of this country, especially for some of us who come from the rural parts of the \\ncountry. He talked about it from production to manufacturing which will not only create food \\nstability but will also create employment for our young people who are languishing in abject \\npoverty, because of lack of employment. \\n\\nThe President also talked about housing which is a source of employment for the young \\npeople in this nation. It will also solve the problems which are faced by the Kenyans who live \\nin urban areas who lack housing and live in shanties. He also talked about the Hustler Fund. I \\nam a true image of a hustler and what he can achieve. The Fund can give potential to young \\npeople who are languishing back at home because they do not have capital to start businesses. \\nIf it is well implemented, it can change the lives of millions of young people who are not paying \\ntaxes because they do not have anything. This will create a tax base for this country. \\n\\nThe President was very honest in his speech by saying that the country does not have \\n\\nmoney. The country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coffers were emptied by the previous regime. We need to do something \\nto  save,  so  that  we  can  invest.  He  addressed  our  problems  and  offered  the  solutions  going \\nforward. \\n\\nI want to donate my time to my brother, Hon. Gideon, who has been waiting for a long \\ntime to say something. People back at home are waiting to listen to the speech of their new \\nMember of Parliament in hotels and kiosks. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. God bless you. \\n\\ntime\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Keiyo South because the Member has donated his \\n\\nHon. Gideon Kimaiyo (Keiyo South, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker and \\nmy  brother,  Hon.  Kiborek.  Before  I  give  my  speech,  I  want  to  inform  you  that  I  am  a  bit \\ndisappointed. I came to this House at 1:15 p.m. \\n \\n\\n(An Hon. Member spoke off record) \\n\\nAllow  me  to  talk.  I  speak  for  many  new  Members  of  Parliament  in  this  House  who \\ncame here very early not only today but also for four days last week. We have been waiting to \\nbe given a chance to speak. It is unfair in all measure. We do not ask for any favour. Be fair to \\nthe new Members. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nI am afraid if this is the going to be the order of business in this House, I will be in trouble with \\nthe Standing Orders because I will ask for a fair share of our time in this House. Congratulations \\nHon. Deputy Speaker on your election. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Give him the microphone. He can have two minutes. \\nHon. Gideon Kimaiyo (Keiyo South, UDA): Okay. I know that was Hon. Kiborek\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\ntime. Thank you for giving me my time. I congratulate you and the Speaker on your election \\nas the Deputy Speaker and the Speaker.

I thank all the wards and the people who \\ncampaigned for me.  \\n\\nI  thank  the  people  of  Kaptarakwa,  Chepkorio,  Soy  North,  Soy  South,  Metkei  and \\nKabiemit wards. I also thank everybody who contributed in one way or another for me to be \\nelected  as  a  Member  of  Parliament.  I  also  thank  the  President  for  nominating  Waziri \\nKipchumba Murkomen to the Cabinet as the Minister for Roads and Infrastructure. He has been \\na father figure to us in Elgeyo Marakwet. I wish him well. Hon. Murkomen has led the way for \\nus in Elgeyo Marakwet where all leaders are young, Hon. Murkomen being the eldest at 41 to \\n42  years.  All  Members  of  Parliament  from  Elgeyo  Marakwet  are  young  turks.  Even  the \\nGovernor,  His  Excellency  Wesley,  is  around  35  years  old.  We  say  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthank  you\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  to  Hon. \\nMurkomen for leading the way.  \\n \\nOn the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, I thank him for his commitment and his determination to \\nlead  this  country  in  the  right  direction.  The  President  promised  a  paradigm  shift  from  the \\nnormal way of doing things\\xe2\\x80\\x94from the politics of tribalism, to the politics of inclusivity and \\nthe politics of issues; a shift from the politics of dynasties, to the politics of hustlers; a shift \\nfrom an economic model of trickle down, to an economic model of bottom up; a shift from \\nsubsidising  consumption,  to  subsidising  production;  a  shift  from  an  economy  that  relies  on \\nexternal  debt,  to  an  economy  that  relies  on  savings;  and,  finally,  a  shift  from  people  being \\nblacklisted on Credit Reference Bureau (CRB), to people accessing credit.  \\n \\nFinally, let me address the people of Keiyo South. I promise them that I will work on \\nthe opening of fluorspar, the construction of Kimwarer Dam that was stopped by the previous \\nregime, and the issue of the shamba system that allows you to plant your maize in the forests \\nat  the  same  time  conserve  the  forests.  I  will  speak  for  construction  of  your  roads  in  the \\nconstituency.  \\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. God bless Kenya. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Let us have the Member for Thika town.  \\n \\n \\nHon. Alice Ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99ang\\xe2\\x80\\x99a (Thika, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I do not know \\nwhether I will be audible enough. I was under the \\xe2\\x80\\x98weather\\xe2\\x80\\x99 over the weekend, but something \\nvery interesting took place. My Arsenal team won the Liverpool match. At least that kept me \\ngoing.  \\n \\nMay  I take this opportunity to congratulate  you and all the leaders in this House for \\nmaking it to the 13th Parliament. I also thank the people of Thika Town Constituency for giving \\nme an opportunity to represent them in this Parliament. I thank everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x94those who prayed \\nfor us, those who prayed for Kenya Kwanza, team Mama that went around and worked hard \\nevery day to make sure that we won. I thank them very much because they made sure we won \\nin every polling center in our constituency. I thank all the generals from Kiambu, led by our \\nLeader  of  Majority  Party,  Hon.  Kimani  Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah.  We  criss-crossed  the  entire  Kiambu \\nCounty and the country in search of votes. Truly, God answered our prayers. That is why we \\nare here today. \\n \\nAs we are aware, it was not an easy thing. We campaigned very hard. The yellow fever \\ntook over. The symptoms were detected across the entire country. Two weeks to 8th August \\n2022, the entire country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s momentum was unstoppable. It was like a Porsche with no brakes. \\nKenya Kwanza was leading in all real polls, not the fake polls from the establishment. We were \\nleading all over. We swept the entire country in voter mobilisation and the readiness to vote. \\nThat is how we found ourselves the majority at the national level, in both Houses and at the \\ncounty level.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the battle was not easy, but we endured. We made sure that with \\nGod on our side, we never agreed to surrender or to be intimidated. We knew all the setbacks \\nwere going to be our setup steps for our blessings.  That is how we made it because our God \\ntook over and made sure that we were going to be living testimonies.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker, if someone ever asks  you  whether  you have ever  witnessed a \\nmiracle, tell them to look at Kenya Kwanza because we are a living testimony of what God can \\ndo when He is on your side. \\n \\nI now want to add my contribution on the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech made on the opening day \\nof this 13th Parliament. The President is a hardworking kind of a man and given a chance, he \\nshall transform this country, restore it and elevate it to unimaginable levels.  In his speech, he \\naffirmed  that  he  was  going  to  jealously  protect  our  Constitution,  guard  our  institutions  by \\nstrengthening the existing ones and to ensure that we do not overrun them. \\n \\nHundreds of men and women in Kenya are going through hardships and the burden is \\ntoo heavy for them to bear.  As we speak, there are many homes that are going without food. \\nWe need to work extra hard and to go back to our basics where agriculture was the backbone \\nof our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy. Provided with all the necessary equipment and produce, our country \\ncan go back to farming. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Chuka/Igambang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ombe. \\n \\nHon.  Patrick  Ntwiga  (Chuka/Igambang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ombe,  UDA):  Thank  you  Hon.  Deputy \\n \\nSpeaker. First, I wish to congratulate you for your election as the Deputy Speaker of this House. \\nHaving a female deputy Speaker is a good thing and it shows what Kenya Kwanza stands for. \\n \\nSecondly, I wish to thank the people of Chuka/Igambang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ombe Constituency who gave \\nme a second chance to represent them in this House. This is a constituency that is known for \\nnot re-electing Members for a second time. I thank them because they made sure that I came \\nback to this House again. \\n \\nI come from a constituency that has very many stalled projects.  Everyone in this House \\nknows  what  happened  during  the  last  campaigns.    Those  who  did  not  support  the  then \\nGovernment had their projects sabotaged.  We have a county headquarter in Tharaka Nithi with \\nno access  road.  The road was assigned a contractor, but because we the people of Tharaka \\nNithi decided to unanimously support the then Deputy President, who is the President now, the \\nproject was sabotaged.  We lobbied again but we got contractors who have never reported to \\nsite up to now. So, we have a non-existent county headquarter. The county headquarters lies in \\nmy constituency. I think it is the only county headquarter in this country that has no court, no \\nHuduma Centre and no facilities at all just because we were punished for supporting the Kenya \\nKwanza Alliance. I wish to thank the President, William Ruto because he recognised all that \\npain  and he has finally rewarded Tharaka Nithi  with  a Cabinet Secretary.  I wish to  tell  this \\nHouse that Tharaka Nithi is the only county, I think, that has never had a Cabinet Secretary \\nsince independence. Kithure Kindiki is the first Cabinet Secretary from Tharaka Nithi.  \\n \\nBeing  a  health  professional,  I  was  very  happy  when  the  President  talked  about \\nUniversal Health Care (UHC). Hon. Deputy Speaker, we can discuss airports and loans but the \\ngreatest burden to the people of this country is in those sectors. I happened to be in the last \\nParliament and we travelled to Cuba to benchmark their system. I want to tell this House that \\nwhen I landed in Cuba I wondered what  we  are doing as a country.  They did not have big \\nhospitals or equipment but it was how they have organised healthcare.  \\n\\nI  felt  so  good  when  the  President  talked  about  primary  healthcare,  preventive  and \\npromotive health care. In this country, we treat our people when they are too sick. We normally \\ntalk theoretically  about  visiting a doctor for check up, but  how many Kenyans can  afford a \\ncheck-up? While on my visit to Cuba with other Members we found a well organised health \\nsystem. For example, in every village, we have a doctor, a clinical officer and a nurse who go \\nhouse to house in a location checking on the people to ensure that they do not get extremely \\nsick before they go to hospital. I really wish that will be the meaning of primary healthcare in \\nthis country.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I come from Tharaka Nithi where we have a bridge called Nithi. \\nThe President in his last speech promised that he would work on this bridge. It has been a killer \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c11th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                 51 \\n\\nbridge in this country. It is not only the people of Tharaka Nithi who die along this bridge. It is \\nreally an issue that the people of Tharaka Nithi would wish the President worked on.  \\n  \\nAdditionally, we know that the President is so passionate about agriculture and until \\npeople can feed themselves they remain  slaves. Agriculture is  the back bone of  the Kenyan \\neconomy. Today  coffee, tea and milk  farmers in Mount Kenya have been made paupers by \\ncartels. When I talk about cartels I cannot forget about the milk sector which has the largest \\ncartels and we know their quotas.  \\n\\n The President also mentioned boda boda and I wish we can remove the high taxes we \\nhave placed on motorbikes so that our young people can, at least, afford to buy boda bodas for \\nthemselves. Most of them are currently working for rich people who can afford to buy them at \\nthat expensive price.  \\n\\nFinally, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I was in my constituency yesterday\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Bomet County also known as Toto \\n \\n\\n(Hon. Member spoke off the record) \\n\\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Member unless you press the intervention button I will \\n\\nnot see you.  \\n\\nMember for Bomet County! \\nHon. Linet Chepkorir (Bomet County,  UDA):  Thank  you, Hon. Deputy  Speaker.  I \\ntake  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  Almighty  Father  for  being  with  us  all.  I  would  like  to \\ncongratulate you on your election as the Hon. Deputy Speaker. I also congratulate Hon. Mosses \\nWetangula, for being elected as the Speaker of this House. I thank the people of Bomet County \\nfor believing in me. I thank them for voting me in and for their prayers.  \\n\\nAs  you  may  know,  I  just  graduated  and  went  to  vie  for  this  particular  seat.  For  the \\npeople  of  Bomet  who  assisted  me,  allow  me  to  mention  one  person  by  the  name  Gideon \\nCheruiyot, who when I declared my ambition he came to my home and asked me whether I \\nwas serious about my ambitions. He then decided to assist me with his boda boda which he \\nused to fuel using his own money. He took me to the campaign field in the morning and back \\nhome in the evening. Gideon wherever you are, may God bless you. You really impacted my \\ncampaign, not forgetting the people of Bomet who printed posters, prayed for me, supported \\nme  financially  and  finally  voted  me  in.  Thank  you  for  believing  in  me  despite  my  age  and \\nstatus. I want to affirm to you that we shall walk together and I will not let you down. I am here \\nin the 13th Parliament to represent your interests.  \\n\\nI  also  want  to  congratulate  the  people  of  Kenya  for  voting  in  our  President,  His \\nExcellency, Hon. (Dr.) William Samoei Ruto. I know that with this new Government, we will \\nassist very many Kenyans. I thank him for introducing the Hustler Fund. I am aware that in the \\n13th  Parliament  we  have  so  many  hustlers  and  in  that  regard,  since  it  is  the  home  of  many \\npeople, everything is possible. Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am happy to stand in this House as the \\nyoungest Parliamentarian in this country. I never take that for granted.  \\n\\nOn  the  President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  speech,  the  President  talked  about  agriculture.  I  know  he  will \\nimprove  on  that  sector  and  our  people,  especially  in  my  County  of  Bomet,  will  be  able  to \\nenhance income and food production.  \\nThere is also the issue of Hustler Fund of Ksh50 billion in each financial year. I know \\n \\nvery many hustlers will be able to be in a better position. We have the hawkers and the Micro \\nSmall  and  Medium-sized  Enterprises  (MSMEs)  that  will  be  able  to  enhance  their  business \\nenterprises. With those few remarks, I thank you. May God bless us all.  \\n \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Mathira.  \\nHon. Eric Kahugu (Mathira, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I must thank \\nyou for giving me this opportunity to make my first speech in this House. Secondly, I must \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

My \\nname is Erick Wamumbi , the Member for Mathira.  \\n\\nMy  election  was  a  miracle.  I  was  not  prepared  for  this  until  the  former  Member  of \\nParliament for Mathira was elevated to become the second Deputy President of this Republic. \\nThat is how my election came by. For that reason, I must thank the people of Mathira for having \\ntrust in me, for believing in me and for electing me to represent them in this august House. I \\nwill not forget to thank my mentor, my friend, His Excellency Rigathi Gachagua who held my \\nhand, who believed in me, and who believed in a young leader.  \\n\\n I  was  agitated  when  the  nominated  Member,  Hon.  Mbadi,  said  that  the  Deputy \\nPresident has been saying that it is their time to eat. I would like to tell Hon. Mbadi that H.E \\nthe Deputy President is not a petty man. He is consistent and he means what he says. He said \\nthat the Government which is led by President William Ruto and his Deputy will work for all \\nthe people of this country \\xe2\\x80\\x94 those who voted for them and those who did not vote for them.  \\nThere are the two things that I took time to listen to in the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech. One is \\nthe Hustler Fund. We have so many young people who are languishing in poverty and some of \\nthem  end  up  seeking  employment  in  foreign  countries  and  they  are  being  tortured  in  those \\ncountries. When that credit is availed we will make sure that young men and women of this \\ncountry engage in business. They will no longer seek employment in countries that are torturing \\nthem.  \\n\\nFinally, on agriculture, I am happy that the President has committed to revive irrigation-\\nfed agriculture as compared to rain-fed agriculture. It is only through business and agriculture \\nthat we are going to revive the economy of this country. We have seen the President and his \\nDeputy have already started distribution of fertiliser to enable farmers engage in farming.  \\n\\nLastly,  the  most  important  thing  they  are  going  to  do  is  to  revive  irrigation-fed \\nagriculture so that our people can engage in farming , and that  the coffee farmer, milk farmer, \\ntea farmer will get their returns at the end of the season. \\n\\nWith those few remarks, I thank you. God bless us all, and God bless Kenya.  \\nHon. Deputy Speaker:  Hon. Members, having completed the four days of debate of \\n\\nthe Address of His Excellency the President, I now call upon the Mover to reply.  \\n\\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wa (Kikuyu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, let me \\ntake this opportunity to thank all the Members. Close to a 133 Members have contributed to \\nthis debate. That is about a third of the Members who sit in this Chamber.  I beg the Members \\nwho are preparing to exit not to do so because I will donate a few minutes to a few of them. I \\ndo not intend to take a lot of time. It is evident that many of the Members in this House support \\nthe  policies  that  were  espoused  by  His  Excellency  the  President.  Indeed,  I  know,  Hon. \\nMembers will be supporting the legislative agenda that His Excellency the President and the \\nGovernment of the Republic of Kenya will be bringing forth to this House.  I am thankful to \\nall the Members.   \\n\\nThere are many pertinent issues that have been raised by Members with regards to the \\nPresident\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech. They include policies, stalled projects all over the country, the state of our \\neconomy, certain counties and part of our constituencies that are being ravaged by the ongoing \\ndrought and indeed even the level and state of healthcare in the  country. I have also heard a \\nnumber of Members in their contributions touch on the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) \\neducation  system  and  as  Members  are  aware,  there  is  already  a  working  party  that  His \\nExcellency the President set in place under the Ministry of Education to look into the CBC.   \\n\\nThe President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Address also challenged this House to amend the Standing Orders to \\nenable Cabinet Secretaries to come and espouse Government policies and tell this House what \\nthey are doing in Government, what policies they are pushing through and to answer Questions \\nand respond to Statements by Members of Parliament on behalf of their constituents.  I think \\nthis is a very good step and those Members who served with us in the 11th and 12th Parliament \\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

That tells you the level of \\nthinking of His Excellency the President. He wants to run an open, transparent and accountable \\nGovernment. I want to challenge Members that when the time comes; as soon as we set up the \\ncommittees on House procedures, they should quickly review the Standing Orders and allow \\nCabinet  Secretaries  to  come  and  answer  our  Questions.    That  will  put  them  to  account  and \\nmake sure that the Government of Kenya is delivering its mandate to the people of Kenya as \\nwas promised during the campaign. \\n\\nWe also have an obligation as Members of Parliament. I did say in my contribution to \\nthis speech, that, the agenda that His Excellency the President espoused through the policies \\nand legislative  proposals  that we will be bring forward are not  for Kenya Kwanza coalition \\nneither for the President William Samoei Ruto, they are for the people of Kenya.  I, therefore, \\nbeg Hon. Members to support the legislative agendas as they are rolled out because they will \\ngo  towards  improving  many  of  our  people  and  improving  our  economy  which  is  quite \\ndilapidated. \\n  \\nIn  conclusion,  I  also  heard  a  few  Members  speak  on  the  issue  of  corruption.    It  is \\nfashionable to speak about corruption, but it is better not to speak about corruption, but to act \\non issues to do with corruption.  I said in my contribution that I know the President and he is a \\nman who may fail to speak but will act.  He is a man of action and indeed, you will bear me \\nwitness  that  the  first  few  things  he  has  done  through  Executive  Orders  have  gone  towards \\nensuring we resource our institutions and institutionalise the fight  against corruption so that \\nthey are able to fight corruption and we do not end up just speaking about it and doing nothing \\nin actual sense.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, with those very many remarks, I now beg to reply. As I do so, \\nlet me donate one minute to  Hon. Harrison Kombe, Hon. Mary Emaase,  Hon. Taitumu  and \\nrepresenting Independents Hon. Kitilai. It must be half a minute each.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member of Kikuyu and the Leader of the Majority Party, you \\nhave already completed the reply. So, you cannot donate the time, you should have done that \\nbefore. \\n \\nmay I then continue. \\n\\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Before I replied? Hon.

Gladys Boss) in the Chair] \\n\\nTHE HANSARD \\n\\nWednesday, 12th October 2022 \\n\\nThe House met at 9.30 a.m. \\n\\nPRAYERS \\n\\nPROCEDURAL MOTION \\n\\nLIMITATION OF DEBATE ON MOTIONS \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, for your information, I know that as many as \\n200 Members did not have an opportunity to make their maiden speeches. I want to inform you \\nthat a maiden speech is a maiden speech, whether you do it today, tomorrow or in two months\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\ntime. And as it is the practice of Parliament, you are normally given some leeway, no matter \\nwhat the debate is about, to make your maiden speech within that particular debate. So, there \\nis  no  cause  to  worry.  Personally,  I  made  my  maiden  speech  two  months  after  I  joined \\nParliament and I had more than 15 minutes to do it. We can move on. \\n\\nLeader of the Majority Party. \\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.  It is, \\nindeed,  true  that  a  number  of  Members  were  not  able  to  make  their  maiden  speeches.  I  am \\nreally thankful to see Hon. Zaheer and other new Members in the House this early. I want to \\nencourage our new Members. These are the very rare opportunities you will get to make your \\nmaiden speeches, especially during debate on procedural motions. I really want to encourage \\nthem to use the opportunity this morning. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I beg to move the following Motion: \\n\\nThat,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Standing  Order  97(1),  this  House \\norders that each speech in a debate on any Motion, including a Special Motion, \\nbe limited in the following manner: A maximum of three hours, with not more \\nthan twenty minutes for the Mover and ten minutes for each Member speaking, \\nexcept the Leader of the Majority Party and the Leader of the Minority Party, \\nwho shall be limited to a maximum of fifteen minutes each, and that ten minutes \\nbefore the expiry of the time, the Mover shall be called upon to reply; and that \\npriority in speaking shall be accorded to the Leader of the Majority Party, the \\nLeader of the Minority Party and the Chairperson of the relevant Departmental \\nCommittee, in that order. \\nFor the benefit of new Members, these procedural Motions on limitation of time are \\ncustomary, to allow ourselves to have adequate time for movers and seconders and to use the \\nlast 10 minutes to reply. When I was replying on the Motion on the Presidential Speech last \\nnight, close to 20 Members were asking me to donate a minute to each. I had only 10 minutes \\nto make my reply. Therefore, it is good for new Members to note that, at the conclusion of a \\ndebate, it is, indeed, possible for the mover to donate a minute or two to another Member. If \\nyou are alone and had not had a chance to contribute, I could donate nine out of the 10 minutes \\nto you and just say: \\xe2\\x80\\x98I beg to reply\\xe2\\x80\\x99, if I have nothing to say in response.  \\n\\nHon. Members will have at least ten minutes to have their take on any Motion. I know \\nthere is a lot of enthusiasm to speak at the beginning of any session of Parliament but, with \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I want to encourage Members to take their time. The time to make your \\nmark in the House is not in the middle of a session. It is usually at the beginning of a session. \\nIn your maiden speech, you will speak uninterrupted for 10 minutes or so. \\n\\nWithout  saying  much,  let  me  ask  the  Leader  of  the  Minority  Party,  Hon.  Opiyo \\n\\nWandayi, to second this Motion. \\n\\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja, ODM): Hon. Deputy Speaker, this being a procedural \\nMotion, I will not say much. Before I second it, I want to associate myself with the remarks \\nthat have been made on the enthusiasm and interest of Members to make their maiden speeches \\non the Floor of this House and, indeed, to contribute to Motions. Since Monday, I have received \\nnumerous complaints from  a number of Members about  logging in,  pressing the button and \\nqueuing for eternity. Some of them have made very interesting accounts that their positions on \\nthe queue kept shifting, moving from 2 to 10 to 15 to 30 and back to 10 and so on and so forth. \\nI know that this can be an issue of technology.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  you  know  from  tradition  and  practice  right  from  the  11th \\nParliament  that  we  have  a  situation  where  the  Speaker  develops  a  practice  of  following  the \\norder of requests for making contribution, even though from time to time, he has to balance \\nother interests of the regions, including the opposite sides.  \\n\\nI  want  to  plead  with  you  that  for  us  to  start  on  the  right  foot,  we  should  have  an \\nopportunity to explain to Members the criterion which is used to give them a chance to speak \\non the Floor of the House, so that there is no feeling or perception that there is some unfairness. \\nThat is basically what I wanted to say because I have received a lot of complaints from across \\nthe political divide, more so from my side of the Coalition. I hope that this is something that \\ncan be addressed amicably and without much ado. \\n \\nTwo, you know that these Members are anxious to be seen talking. That is why they \\nare here. Their constituents want to see them on the screens. They want to hear their voices \\ndiscussing issues of national importance and their interests in the constituencies.  \\n \\nlimiting time for debate, which is a practice and tradition. \\n\\nI wish to second the Motion as moved by Hon. Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah. It is basically a matter of \\n\\nSo, without further ado, I second the Motion.    \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you, Leader of the Minority Party. Before I propose the \\nquestion, I agree with you that it is important for Members to understand the standard criterion \\nwhich is used. We follow the order in which one logged in. There is also a question on whether \\nnumbers  move  back  and  forth  in  the  request  list.  The  Information  and  Communications \\nTechnology (ICT) team will look into that.  \\n \\nSome Members complained that they were in the list and then suddenly, they were not \\nthere and their machines went off. Others could not log in at all. However, those matters will \\nbe addressed by the ICT Department. Members follow the order.  \\n\\nHowever, yesterday being one of the first few days of Parliament, it was also important \\nthat if three Members from one region followed each other, then the only correct thing to do \\nwas to  balance by  skipping to  the nearest  one from  a different  part of the country, political \\nparty, and make sure that there was a gender balance. You saw that Hon. Tim Wanyonyi was \\nright at the bottom, but we jumped to him because he represents a certain class. However, as \\nwe go along, we will improve. Members, we will look into that.  \\n \\n\\nThank you. \\n \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Members: Put the Question. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker: Leader of the Majority Party. \\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. Before \\nI  move  the  second  Motion,  it  is  worth  noting  that  having  passed  that  Procedural  Motion,  I \\nbelieve that this Motion which is Order 9 is now subject to those timelines.  \\n \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I beg to move the following Motion:  \\n \\n\\nTHAT, pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order 204, this House approves \\nthe appointment of the following Members to the Committee on Appointments, in addition to \\nthose specified under paragraph (1):   \\n\\n1.  Hon. Nelson Koech, MP. \\n2.  Hon. (Ms.) Rahab Wachira Mukami, MP. \\n3.  Hon. Dido Ali Raso, MP. \\n4.  Hon. George Gitonga Murugara, MP. \\n5.  Hon. David Gikaria, MP. \\n6.  Hon. Ferdinand Wanyonyi, MP. \\n7.  Hon. (Ms.) Mary Emaase, MP. \\n8.  Hon. Abdul Rahim Dawood, MP. \\n9.  Hon. Junet Mohamed, MP, CBS. \\n10.  Hon. Caleb Amisi. \\n11.  Hon. Stephen Mule, MP. \\n12.  Hon. Abdi Shurie, MP. \\n13.  Hon. (Ms.) Naisula Lesuuda, MP. \\n14.  Hon. David Pkosing, MP, CBS. \\n15.  Hon. (Ms.) Mishi Mboko, MP, CBS. \\n\\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, it is imperative to note that this House ought to have approved \\nthis Committee within seven days upon the assembly of a new House. You know the challenges \\nwe had. We were unable to do that.  \\n\\nHowever, pursuant to the Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s directives in his Message on the 6th October 2022, \\nyou remember that he indicated that we need to set up this committee by, at least, 12th October, \\n2022, which I believe is today. We are at, least, within time to have it in place. Hon. Members \\nare aware that His Excellency the President also conveyed a Message to the House nominating \\nfor appointment certain persons to the offices of the Attorney-General, Secretary to the Cabinet \\nand those who will take office as Cabinet Secretaries. For that to happen, Members are also \\naware  that  they  must  go  through  vetting.  This  is  the  Committee  that  is  charged  with  that \\nresponsibility to consider those nominees for appointment as Cabinet Secretaries.  \\n \\nIt is quite a very important Committee that is set out in our Constitution. Article 152 \\n(2) of the Constitution says that the President shall nominate and, with approval of the National \\nAssembly,  appoint  Cabinet  Secretaries.  That  being  a  constitutional  obligation  that  has  been \\ngiven  to  this  House  through  this  Committee,  then  none  of  those  Cabinet  Secretaries,  the \\nAttorney General or the Secretary to the Cabinet will take office and transact business on behalf \\nof Kenyans and the Government of Kenya, unless they are considered by this Committee and \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I can see the Leader of the Minority Party emeritus, Hon. John Mbadi, \\nin a very animated conversation with somebody behind me. \\n\\nLet me also take this opportunity to thank the leadership of the Minority Party in the \\nHouse. You remember, in the 12th Parliament, we considered nominees to Cabinet on one side \\nof the political divide, without the participation of the Minority. My hearty congratulations go \\nto  the  leadership  of  the  Minority  in  the  13th  Parliament  because  they  have  been  very \\nmagnanimous and have exhibited very good leadership.  \\n\\nWhen we met at the House Business Committee yesterday, we were able to go through \\nthe  list  of  proposed  names,  from  both  the  Majority  and  Minority  Parties.  We  agreed \\nunanimously on the names that are here before the House. You will bear me witness that the \\nnames are not just of seasoned Members of this House. They include Members who represent \\nvarious interests. They are with a very good regional, ethnic and religious balance, and other \\ninterests in the country. This is to make sure that we afford the people of Kenya the opportunity \\nto follow. We do these things in a very transparent and accountable manner as a House. The \\npeople of Kenya will be able to follow us live on television as we vet the Cabinet Secretaries.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, for the benefit of the members of the public, it is worth noting \\nthat the Office of the Clerk of the National Assembly has notified the public all the details of \\nthe said  vetting. What  remains, therefore, is  for this Committee to  commence the necessary \\napproval by this House. I believe that if there are any Kenyans out there who have a memoranda \\nor anything that they would like to submit to the House and the Committee to consider during \\nthe vetting process, they know they have until Thursday this week to do so. I assure the country \\nthat this Committee will consider all memoranda brought before the House. We will be fair \\nand just to everybody. Those who will submit memoranda will have a fair opportunity to be \\nheard  or  their  memoranda  to  be  considered.  Those  about  whom  memoranda  have  been \\nsubmitted will have an opportunity to be heard and have their say before the Committee. \\nI do not want to belabour this point. Having passed the procedural Motion, I am sure \\n \\nMembers are eager to contribute. I encourage all of us to support this Motion. As I said, it is a \\nCommittee  that  we  have  agreed  upon  between  ourselves  in  the  Majority  Party  and  my \\ncolleagues in the Minority Party.  \\n\\nLet me, once again, commend the leadership of the Minority. This time round, in the \\n13th Parliament, they will  participate in  this process.  This  is the spirit we want  to  see going \\nforward.  As  His  Excellency  the  President  did  beseech  the  House,  a  bipartisan  approach  to \\nissues  is  good.  None  of the  nominees  for  Cabinet  Secretary  is  assured  of  their  job  until  the \\nHouse approves them.  \\n \\nEven  as  we  approve  these  nominees,  it  is  important  to  note  that  we  shall  soon  be \\nchanging our Standing Orders to have whoever is approved as a Cabinet Secretary to appear \\nbefore this House to answer questions, statements and matters of concern to members of the \\npublic. As we wish all the nominees all the best as they prepare to appear before the Committee \\non Appointments, I alert them that I am certain all these Members in the 13th Assembly are \\nvery eager to hold them to account on their actions in public and in private. I also tell them \\nearly enough that His Excellency the President has made it clear, at least, to those of us in the \\nleadership,  that  he  will  allow  Parliament  to  exercise  its  mandate  without  hindrance,  undue \\ninfluence and interference.  \\nWe should relax when we see His Excellency the President appear for lunch. We must \\n \\nalways remember that with the Deputy President, they are former Members of Parliament. It is \\ngood for them to interact with Members of Parliament. Having the Executive coming for lunch \\nin the Legislature is one of those few and rare opportunities. We continue to welcome them. \\nHowever, we will do our work as Members of Parliament to oversight and offer meaningful \\noversight on the Government. I invite those of us in the Minority and even ourselves in the \\nMajority Party to exercise that oversight and representation role in this House without fear.

Nobody will be coerced or intimidated \\nto  take  whatever  position  even  in  the  approval  of  these  nominees  as  we  consider  their \\nappointment at the Committee on Appointments. \\n \\ndebate the appointment of these names, we contribute to this Motion\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n\\nWith those very many remarks, I beg to move. I appeal to all of us that, even as we \\n\\nHon. (Dr).  Makali Mulu  (Kitui  Central, WDM):  On a point of order, Hon. Deputy \\n\\nSpeaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Kitui Central, what is your point of order? \\n \\n \\nHon. (Dr.) Makali Mulu (Kitui Central, WDM): Hon. Deputy Speaker, you know that \\nour Standing Orders allow that a Member who says \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoint of order\\xe2\\x80\\x9d should be given a chance \\nto say what is wrong with what is being said.  I am listening to my friend, the Leader of  the \\nMajority Party, Hon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah. He is saying that oversight belongs to the Minority. \\nI  think  our  Constitution  is  very  clear.  Oversight  is  the  work  of  all  Members  of  Parliament \\nbecause we do not have the Government in the House. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nI  ask  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  to  declare  my  friend  out  of  order  because  he  is \\n\\n \\n \\nmisleading Kenyans.  \\n \\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: The Leader of the Majority Party. \\n \\nHon.  Kimani  Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah  (Kikuyu,  UDA):  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  you  know  Dr. \\nMakali  Mulu  is  my  friend  as  he  says.  But  I  think  that  from  where  he  is  sitting,  he  was  not \\nlistening to me. If he was, he did not hear what I said. I said I encourage those of you in the \\nMinority Party, as  I also encourage those of us in the Majority  Party. That  we exercise our \\noversight role without fear or intimidation; without fear that anybody will coerce you or come \\nto audit your NG-CDF on account of your position, or that anybody will take you to DCI for \\nthe positions you take. Therefore, Hon. Makali, relax! You have nothing to fear. \\n\\nWhat he is saying is, indeed, true and it is as I had said. Maybe, it bypassed his ears that \\nour role as Members of Parliament is to oversight Government. That is why I encouraged us \\nthat, even as we settle down and have the Procedures and House Rules Committee, we hasten \\nto  amend our Standing  Orders. This  is  to  ensure that these Cabinet Secretaries do not  grow \\nhorns  as  soon  as  they  are  appointed.  They  must  know  that  the  people  who  have  vetted  and \\napproved them reside in this House. They must be responsive to the needs and aspirations of \\nthe Kenyan people that are represented by their representatives in this House.  \\nIn  conclusion,  I  encourage  all  of  us  to  support  this  bipartisan  and  well-balanced \\n \\nCommittee. I also encourage the Members of this Committee to take time to consider the work \\nthat  is  ahead  of  them.  Without  pre-empting  debate,  from  what  I  see  on  the  business  of  this \\nafternoon on the calendar of the House, we could consider taking a short break. The reason we \\nwill need a short break at the end of this week is for this Committee on Appointments and the \\nCommittee on Selection to take time to consider the work that is ahead of them. That is so that \\nwe also allow His Excellency the President to appoint those that will have been approved by \\nthe House.  \\n \\nParty to second this Motion. \\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: The Leader of the Minority Party. \\n \\n \\nHon.  Opiyo  Wandayi  (Ugunja,  ODM):  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  I  rise  to  second  this \\nMotion. The appointment of this Committee is obviously a matter which is in line with Article \\n\\nWith that, I beg to move and request my good friend and the Leader of the Minority \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

This House has the power and mandate to approve the appointment \\nof those who have been nominated by the President to serve as Cabinet Secretaries. This is, \\nhowever, buttressed by our Standing Orders No.45. The notion that sometimes gets peddled \\nout there that this House is simply a rubber stamp is false. This House cannot be a rubber stamp. \\nThis  House  is  exercising  its  constitutional  duty  under  Article  152(2)  of  the  Constitution  by \\nvetting nominees for appointment to Cabinet Secretaries. \\n\\nI was amazed last week to read an Article in one of the dailies by a notable columnist \\nby the name Barrack Muluka. He was quoted having said that the President should be given \\nfreedom and leeway to appoint those whom he wants to work with, and that there should be no \\nimpediments placed on the path of the President in choosing those he wants to work with.  \\n\\nThe  problems  in  this  country  is  at  times  about  intellectuals  who  when  turned  into \\napologists of the establishment, get their thinking wrong. Nothing can be far from the truth. \\nWe are a House comprising of Hon. Members of Parliament from both sides of the divide.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Tim Wanyonyi (Westlands, ODM): On a point of order, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Westlands, what is your point of order? \\nHon. Tim Wanyonyi (Westlands, ODM): Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is not a call for a \\n\\npoint of order. I am queuing to contribute to this Motion.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: There are 50 requests of Members to speak to this Motion and \\n\\nfive interventions of exactly the same people in that order.  \\n\\nFirst, you may need to remove your intervention button, and queue because you are all \\nthere. I can name the Members who are already in the queue. They are Members for Tharaka, \\nMumias East, Kacheliba and Malava. Each of you is in the queue in that order, at the top of the \\npage.  \\n\\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I hope you \\n\\nwill indulge the Member for Westlands when the time comes.  \\n\\nThis is one of the most critical duty of the National Assembly of the Republic of Kenya \\n\\nunder the 2010, Constitution.  \\n\\nThe idea of vetting persons nominated to be appointed as state officers is a noble idea. \\nIf you want to know how serious this exercise is in some jurisdictions, take a visit to the United \\nStates of America (USA) Senate during their confirmation hearings. It is such a serious exercise \\nthat  Capitol  Hill  comes  to  a  standstill  when  the  USA  Senate  is  conducting  confirmation \\nhearings of nominees appointed by the President of USA. For us therefore, being a presidential \\nsystem in line with the US system, we need to equally take this exercise seriously. Article 152 \\n(2) of the Constitution and Standing  Order No.45 says that this House in its entirety, is  the \\norgan that does the vetting. The Committee will, of course, do the nitty gritties, but this House \\nhas got the ultimate power to reject or approve every single nominee. It is a duty that we must \\nexercise judicially, with utmost decorum and seriousness.  \\n\\nWe have been told that the Constitution provides frameworks for those appointments. \\nAs we know, however, even as the Committee on Appointment starts its sitting once approved, \\nI  will  ask  them  from  the  beginning,  and  this  is  very  important,  that  even  as  we  look  at  the \\nsuitability or otherwise, of individual persons who have been nominated by the President, you \\nneed to first look at the whole package in context. Does it meet the tenets of the Constitution?  \\nArticle  10  of  the  Constitution  clearly  talks  about  values  and  principles  of  good \\ngovernance and national values. We know there are issues of equity and regional balance. Do \\nwe  have  a  sense  of  that  in  the  entire  package?  Before  you  get  to  address  the  suitability  of \\nindividual Members, does it meet the gender balance? Does it address issues of Persons Living \\nwith  Disabilities  (PWDs)  and  so  forth?  We  must  not  lose  sight  of  the  requirements  of  the \\nConstitution,  dictates  and  requirements  of  the  Leadership  and  Integrity  Act,  Public  Officer \\nEthics Act and the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

If the President, therefore, brings the names of persons who in the wisdom of \\nthis House do not pass the suitability test, we are not trying to dictate to the President on who \\nto appoint. Far from it! We are simply telling him that if he has the time to go back and choose \\nfrom those who can pass among the 25 million or so Kenyans, let him do so. I am not inciting \\nanyone. I am simply preparing a ground for the Committee and the whole House that when \\nembarking on this onerous task, we must be alive to the dictates of the Constitution and other \\nstatutes that govern matters of governance and good order.  \\n\\nAs  I  conclude,  we  have  been  told  a  number  of  times  -  and  we  agree  -  that  the \\nConstitution of Kenya guarantees that everyone is innocent until he or she is proven guilty or \\notherwise. \\nHon. David Ochieng' (Ugenya, MDG): On a point of Order.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Ugenya. \\n \\n \\nHon. David Ochieng' (Ugenya, MDG): Hon. Deputy Speaker, I have a lot of respect \\nfor  my  friend  and  neighbour  who  probably  is  my  senior.  Member  for  Ugunja,  you  are  law \\nschool, and so you could be my senior.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, is he pre-empting the debate on the names that could come to \\nthis Floor? Is he pre-empting debate on what could happen on Committee on Appointments \\nhearing? By the way he is going, I fear that he has already made up his mind on the debate we \\nare going to have when the names come to this Floor. Is he in Order?  \\n \\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja, ODM): Hon. Deputy Speaker, if you have been keenly \\nfollowing my comments, I have been very careful. I have not mentioned any names and I will \\nnot, for sure, at this point in time. I am just trying to lay the basis. It is my obligation to guide \\nmy Members and everybody else who may want to be guided, that this is a very serious exercise \\nthat we must approach with a lot of seriousness on our part.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  I  want  to  say  this.  Persons  being  appointed  to  state  or  public \\noffices, just as the Constitution requires, must be persons whose conduct bring honour, dignity \\nand everything that is positive to the offices. As I second this Motion, I just want to plead that \\nthis is one such exercise that this House, once it embarks on, the country must be convinced \\nthat the House has done justice not only to the process itself, but to those persons whose names \\nhave been dropped before the Committee and the House for approval.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I second.  \\n\\n \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: I can see that there are those of you who want to contribute; \\nyou can do so by way of putting in the request.  On top of my page,  I have the Member for \\nStarehe Constituency. \\n \\nHon. Amos Maina (Starehe, JP): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this \\nopportunity to address the House. I am Hon. Amos Mwago, Member for Starehe Constituency \\nin  Nairobi  City.  First,  I  want  to  thank  God  for  this  opportunity  to  arrive  to  this  House  to \\ncontribute to the matters of national interest. I also want to thank the great people of Starehe \\nConstituency for electing me as a Member of Parliament to represent them here. I will not miss \\nout congratulating you and Hon. Wetangula for your election as Deputy Speaker and Speaker \\nof this House respectively.  \\n\\nI have been elected to this House to represent people who are mainly \\xe2\\x80\\x98hustlers,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as the \\ngovernment  of  the  day  came  up  with  the  narrative.  Basically,  my  constituents  are  looking \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Based on the \\ntoo many promises that the President promised us, my people are very optimistic that this is \\ntheir time.  \\n \\nThe Government is on a wave of economic liberation. Most of the people in Nairobi \\nCity are hopeful that most of what has been promised to them will be achievable; and that the \\nenvironment will be conducive for them to do business. They also hope that new markets are \\ngoing  to  be  constructed  in  Nairobi  to  accommodate  the  many  people  who  are  unemployed. \\nThey are hopeful that job opportunities are going to be created for them by this Government. \\nIn general, my constituents are very hopeful that their livelihoods will improve. That is why, \\nbeing one of them, I am here to represent and bring their grievances.  \\n\\nI want to thank the President on the promises that he gave to the people, starting with \\nwhat he calls the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHustlers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Fund.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A lot people in Nairobi came from up-country to look for \\njob opportunities. They are optimistic that measures, structures and systems that will make sure \\nthat their businesses are safeguarded and thrive on a growth path are going to be put in place. \\n \\nAbout housing, I am an MP for a constituency that has a very huge population living in \\nthe slums. These people are optimistic that the affordable housing plan that the Government \\npromised will help them redeem their livelihoods by providing decent housing. Their major \\nconcern is that maybe the structures that are going to be used in the schemes may not address \\nthe real issues facing the people. We have seen other housing plans being brought on board, \\nwhere people who benefit are not slum dwellers. These houses have been brought up and sold \\nout to other people who are not the residents of these areas. For us, it becomes a scheme to \\nevacuate some people and develop these places to be sold to people who are not needy. That is \\na  concern  that  my  constituents  have  raised.  We  want  participation  and  involvement  by  the \\nlocals. The real champions of these schemes should be the structure owners \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the landladies \\nand landlords in the slums \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who should be at the forefront of implementation of the schemes. \\nYet most often than not, when we have these upgrades, these people are taken for granted and \\nare vacated from their lands. When the houses are developed beautifully, they are sold to people \\nwith  more money. That  is  one issue that people have raised, and we need to  address  it. We \\ncannot displace people and bring in other people who are not our constituents.  \\n\\nOn the matter at hand about the Committee on Appointments, I urge that Committee to \\nvet  the nominees wisely. We are in  a new economic dispensation. We have never tried this \\nBottom-Up Model before. It is at its initial stages. We need people who understand it very well \\nto be its drivers. These are the people who are able to articulate issues and meet the expectations \\nthat people on the ground have. They are so hopeful about this whole Bottom-Up Model. But \\nif we do not have the right drivers of this model, it might just turn out to be something else that \\nwill not work. \\nIn the Ministry of Trade, my constituents are also traders. The narrative has changed \\n \\nfrom focusing on big traders to mama mboga\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, boda boda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and other people in the informal \\nsector. My people expect that the Cabinet Secretary (CS) for Trade, Investment and Industry \\nis going to address the issues from those simple setups. On matters of the cottage industries \\nand the informal sector, how are they going to formalise the informal sector, which employs \\ntoo many people in this City? How will he go around the issue of import duty, taxes, widening \\nof the tax-base and reducing taxes on our people? We are also interested in knowing how he is \\ngoing to expand opportunities to reach to other regions so that our people can trade with other \\nregions.  So, when it comes to  vetting, issues on integrity,  capability, and experience  should \\ntake centre stage.   \\n\\nWe, Nairobi residents, hope that whoever gets into the Ministry of Trade, Investment \\nand Industry is going to liberalise trade in Nairobi. We expect more markets to be built so that \\nthey can accommodate our people. We expect so much that will change our economy. As we \\ntry to adopt this bottom-up economy, we expect people who run small businesses in Nairobi to \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

They may have come to the politics of mwananchi. We expect the Cabinet that is \\ngoing to be appointed by the President to show some difference in the way they are going to \\nrun  their  affairs.  They  need  to  ensure  that  their  relationship  with  the  local  mwananchi  is \\nretained, just as they did during the campaigns, where they brought the local mwananchi to be \\ntheir point of focus. I, therefore, expect that when they are running the Government, to consider \\nthe local mwananchi. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, as we move forth, we also have our questions as the youth of \\nKenya about youth representation in the Cabinet. I know the committee that is going to vet is \\ngoing to look into regional balance and everything, but also our role as the youth should be a \\nconsideration. We look forward to seeing that we are represented in the Cabinet. \\n\\nWe  also  have  another  question  of  incorporating  Information  Communication  and \\nTechnology  (ICT)  in  all  the  operations  of  the  Government.  In  this  21st  Century,  where \\ntechnological advancements are happening so fast, we are reluctant to adopt new technology \\nin all operations of our ministries.  \\n\\nI thank you and donate my five minutes to Hon. Babu Owino. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Your time is up. I now call Hon. Member for Kacheliba. \\nHon. Titus Lotee (Kacheliba, KUP): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. In contributing \\nto today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Motion, I take this opportunity to recognise that this is my first time to speak in this \\naugust House. I beg to get some time to be able to give my maiden speech. Above all, I want \\nto  thank  the  Almighty  God  for  having  allowed  me  the  opportunity  to  serve  the  people  of \\nKacheliba. At the same time, I wish to congratulate you for having been elected as the Deputy \\nSpeaker of this House. I know the capacity that you have, as I have worked with you before. I \\nam sure that you are able to perform above and beyond the expectations of this House based \\non our previous engagement. I also watched you when you worked in the Judiciary. You did \\nus proud. \\n\\nI wish to thank the people of Kacheliba. These are the people that brought me into this \\naugust  House.  It  was  my  first  attempt  to  come  here,  and  they  were  able  to  give  me  the \\nopportunity,  most  particularly  the  women  that  wore  the  most  adorable,  magnanimous  and \\nunique trademark cloth called lorwaa of Kacheliba. You actually need to see this clothing for \\nyou to appreciate the kind of women who voted for me. I wish to thank them most profusely \\nfor giving me the opportunity, and trusting in my capabilities to be able to represent their issues \\nin this House. \\n\\nI thank particularly the Chairman of my party, the Kenya Union Party (KUP), that gave \\nme the ticket to vie and be an honourable Member of this august House. Thank you very much \\nthe  people  of  Kacheliba,  the  youth,  those  that  believed  in  my  capacity  and  those  that  will \\ncontinue to believe in it. I thank my predecessor of Kacheliba Constituency. I want to promise \\nthat it was a political duel, and not enmity. The people had their trust, and I am able to continue \\nwith the work that you did. I wish you well in your endeavours. I wish you well, Mheshimiwa \\nMark Lomunokol, the one that I dethroned. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, today, we are here to contribute to the Motion of the committees \\nthat are going to vet the CSs. I want to appreciate the fact that we are giving the task to discuss \\nabout these committees and also to give them what is on our minds. I strongly believe that the \\nConstitution is clear, and the President has followed the Constitution when he appointed seven \\nout of the 21 women. Personally, I know that vetting can throne and dethrone some of those \\nwomen. I ask this House to consider more specifically the fact that when the women that are \\nnominated  by  the  President  are  brought  in  for  vetting,  those  Committees  need  to  be  very \\nhumane in understanding them. The reason is that there are seven women out of 21 Cabinet \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

If one of them is vetted out, it basically means that we are not going to get \\nthe one-third gender rule that we always looked for. I think the President never allowed us to \\nget  an extra one or two more nominees beyond the seven for women, which means that we \\nneed to have trust and faith in them. That is one of the requests. \\n\\n The other request is to ask the team that is going to vet the CSs to consider critically \\nthose nominees that are going to fall on the Standing Order that is going to be changed on the \\nFloor of this House. The President asked that we need to change a particular Standing Order \\nso that the CSs can directly come to Parliament to answer questions. It is very easy for us to \\nsay that we are going to change the Standing Orders so that they can come here. I know that \\nthe practice is that immediately they sit, they grow horns and start sending their representatives, \\nas the Leader of the Majority Party said. I want this House to not only consider the characters \\nof the persons, but also to look at them and know the kind of people that they are going to vet \\ninto this House. I have sat in the Executive some time back, and I know that it is very easy for \\na CS to travel abroad and consequently send representatives. We want the Standing Orders to \\nbe followed to the latter, and at the vetting point, I want that question be set before each of the \\nnominees.  They  should  all  be  asked  if  they  are  willing  to  come  personally  to  this  House  to \\nanswer to questions, or whether they are just going to send representatives, like many of them \\nwould want to, when they become the bosses and not the servants of the people.  \\n\\nI also hope that the committee that is going to vet these CSs will look at the issues that \\nare affecting this country. Personally, I come from Kacheliba Constituency. Hon. Members, I \\nam from a new constituency in this country. Kacheliba is a Constituency that was established \\nin 1972, when most of you already had their constituencies formed in Kenya. I am also a new \\nMP  who  was  elected  in  a  by-election  within  the  main  election,  in  that  when  you  had  your \\nelections on the 9th of August, I did mine after the 9th of August; that is, at the 29th of August. \\nThat basically means that I am a product of a by-election within an election, something that is \\nso unique in this country.  \\n\\nJust to bring you to speed, by its name, Kacheliba is a place where the colonialists used \\nto sit and detain people who could not pay. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Ka\\xe2\\x80\\x99 means \\xe2\\x80\\x98the home of,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98cheliba\\xe2\\x80\\x99 means \\nhajalipa. So, it is the home of the person who was arresting people who had not paid. I want \\nthis to be considered. This constituency basically means that people living there did not have \\nthe means to pay the Europeans or the white man. As we vet the CSs, let us consider areas that \\nare far-flung, those that have been oppressed by history, and where people have never known \\nand tasted the dignities that every other Kenyan has tasted. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker,  I  come from an area that is bedevilled  with  insecurity.  Every \\ntime people mention the Pokot community, they talk about them as people who are backwards. \\nI want to state it clearly in this House that as we do our vetting, not every Pokot is a criminal. \\nIn fact, the criminals are very few, and they are in a very particular place that is not West Pokot. \\nI  want  this to  be considered. The person that will  take the internal  security  docket  needs to \\nconsider how to handle issues of insecurity differently. From Jomo Kenyatta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Government, \\nthrough Moi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Kibaki\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, to Kenyatta Juniors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Government, insecurity issues of the Kerio \\nValley have been treated with a lot of disdain. We have seen security persons going in after \\ninsecurity incidences, and what they have only done is to earn per diem that is in the millions \\nof shillings. These moneys could have been used to improve the social economic situation of \\nthis place. When we are vetting the CSs that will deal with internal security, I want the team to \\nlook at a person that will come with innovative ways of dealing with the issues of insecurity. \\nIf we continue doing things the way we have done them before, then we are not going to change \\nthe situation. We will be speaking about insecurity in these regions for a long time. Since I will \\nnot  sit  in  this  committee,  I  ask  every  Member  that  will  represent  us  in  this  Committee  on \\nVetting to inform the CS nominee that situations need to be handled differently. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker, I repeat that your capacities and capabilities are beyond what I \\nknow.  I know that you are going to surprise this House. I thank this House for listening to my \\nfirst speech. I thank the people of Kacheliba so much for having faith in me and giving me the \\nopportunity to speak on their behalf in this House.  \\n\\nThank you. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you for your kind words, Member for Kacheliba.  \\nI now call upon the Member for Kisumu Central. \\nHon. Joshua Oron (Kisumu Central, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. Let \\nme first take this opportunity to congratulate you for having been elected as the Deputy Speaker \\nof  this  House.  Let  me  also  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  all  Members  of  this  august \\nHouse for having been re-elected or elected, for those who are new like myself. Let me take a \\nspecial  opportunity  to  thank  the  people  of  Kisumu  Central  for  having  faith  in  me,  and  for \\nelecting me as their representative in this House.  \\n\\nKisumu Central is a business town and a business hub. Kisumu Central has a population \\nof about 200,000 people and about 135,000 voters. The constituency has six wards; Kondele \\nBarracks is  in  Kisumu Central.  Kondele is  an undocumented  Barracks. Kisumu Central  has \\nNyalenda B Ward. I thank the people of Nyalenda B. I also thank Kondele People, the people \\nof Railway Ward, Kaloleni Shaurimoyo and the Central Business District (CBD), which forms \\nthe Market and Milimani Ward, for electing me to this August House. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, in Kisumu Central, we have slums and urban specific wards. I \\nam more concerned about Nyalenda B, because it is a ward which floods almost every single \\nyear. Let me talk to the Ministry of Public Service, Gender, Senior Citizens Affairs and Special \\nProgrammes. Nyalenda B, which is seen as a town, should be treated like any other drought \\nand flooding area. When the Ministry is considering areas which are drought stricken, it should \\nalso consider Nyalenda B.  \\n\\nKisumu Central is a cosmopolitan town. A constituency which is also a home of special \\ntalents. Some of the famous footballers who have played for Kenya come from Kisumu Central. \\nI can mention Peter Dawo and Dennis Oliech, for those who are fans of football. It is also a \\nvery peaceful constituency.  \\n\\nKisumu Central has very important projects which have stalled. The projects have not \\nbeen looked at over the years. I will just mention a few. The Kisumu Cotton Mills (KICOMI) \\nis a big sleeping giant that could create employment opportunities to the youth. It could also \\ncreate  employment  opportunities  to  the  farmers,  because  it  is  a  fabric  industry  which,  if \\nrehabilitated,  will  respond  to  some  of  our  unemployment  needs.  Kenya  Matches  is  another \\nstalled project in Kisumu. There are also about three fish industries which are stalled. I will be \\ntalking to various State Departments and Ministries to ensure that these projects are brought \\nback into action to create employment.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I want to thank and congratulate the outgoing administration, the \\nregime  of  President  Uhuru  Kenyatta  under  the  handshake.  They  did  show  Kisumu  Central \\npeople that they are also part of Kenyans. As part of the handshake, we saw the rehabilitation \\nof  Kisumu  Port,  the  railway  line  that  is  now  moving  up  and  down.  We  also  saw  the \\nimprovement of some of the road networks, the rehabilitation of the MV Uhuru Ship, which is \\nnow  a  major  transportation  mode  to  our  neighbouring  countries;  and  the  revival  of  the \\nbreweries, which is still ongoing. \\n\\nHon.  Deputy Speaker, some of our slums experience the worst floods in the region. \\nThis is a problem that causes havoc to the community in those specific wards, especially the \\nresidents of Nyalenda. It is worth noting that Kapuodhe in particular in Nyalenda B is also a \\nvery fertile area.  If the floods can be controlled, it will be a food basket not only for Kisumu \\nCentral  area,  but  also  for  the  People  of  Kisumu  County.  In  the  very  near  future,  I  will  be \\nexploring other development partners, ministries and also the county government to see how \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I  will  be  seeking  special \\ninterventions from the Special Programmes Department and the relevant ministries. I will also \\nlook into short-term measures so that the people who have been displaced, and who are staying \\nin churches and other social areas, can be supported when other areas with drought and floods \\nare being supported. As we speak, I have residents who are still staying in churches because of \\nfloods. Our appeal to the State Department of Special Programmes has gone unheard. \\n\\nKisumu Central is a business hub, a fast-growing constituency and city with a lot of \\nopportunities. I welcome and invite other Members interested in business to come and invest \\nin  Kisumu  Central  business  hub.  There  are  opportunities  for  tourism,  hotel  and  hospitality, \\nhealthcare and blue economy. I welcome and invite those who are interested in investing in \\nKisumu. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I am aware that we finished the discussion on\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you, Member for Kisumu Central.  \\nI now call upon the Member for Gatundu South.  \\nHon. GG Kagombe (Gatundu South, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for the \\nopportunity to address this House. This is my first substantive address. In fact, it is my maiden \\nspeech.  Therefore,  I  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  people  of  Gatundu  South  for  having \\nfound  it  fit  to  elect  me  to  represent  them  in  this  House.  I  also  take  this  opportunity  to \\ncongratulate you, Hon. Gladys Boss and Hon. Moses Wetangula, for having been elected as \\nDeputy  Speaker  and  Speaker  respectively.  The  same  also  goes  to  the  President  and  Deputy \\nPresident, mutatis mutandis.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  I  come  to  this  House  with  a  background  of  a  lot  of \\nunemployment.  Hence,  as  we  discuss  the  business  of  the  day  and  the  Committee  on \\nAppointments, it is no loss for me, because this Committee has to shoulder the responsibility \\nof ensuring that we have people who will drive the Government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agenda. Without the Cabinet, \\nthen it will be very hard to push the business of the Government ahead. Therefore, they have a \\nhuge responsibility on their shoulders.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, in as much as we finished discussing the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech, it \\nwas very pregnant with a lot of information and issues that we need to address, as a country. \\nAs  we  talk  about  employment,  it  cannot  be  achieved  without  looking  at  manufacturing  and \\nindustrialisation in this country. However, our industrialisation is hampered by taxation, our \\nexisting tax regime and tax infrastructure.  \\n\\nLooking at our tax regime, we now have a Value Added Tax (VAT) that is very punitive \\nto the business people. I am looking at a proposal that was brought to this House suggesting \\nwe should have a VAT regime that stops a business person from filing returns if they have filed \\nnil return for one month. We must look at changes that must be instituted to enable our people \\nto have a proper working tax regime so they can invest in this country.  \\n\\nWe have this tendency of taxing our people on trade. As a manufacturer, we are paying \\nelectricity to a tune of Ksh21 to produce one kilogram of tea. This is because we have tax on \\nfuel and electricity that hampers our trade and production. Therefore, we cannot issue or give \\nemployment to our young people if we continue like this. I ask the Committee that is going to \\ndetermine who will be the CSs in charge of industrialisation, agriculture and finance to look at \\nour tax system so it can enable businesses to thrive in this country.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the people of Gatundu South are a worried lot because they are \\none hospital bill away from abject poverty. I look at a situation where we must fix our health \\nsector  so  we  can  achieve  universal  healthcare.  For  us  to  achieve  this,  we  must  address  two \\nissues.  First,  we  must  address  National  Hospital  Insurance  Fund  (NHIF),  which  has  been \\npaying 80 per cent of its pay-out to less than 25 per cent of the hospitals. These are hospitals \\nin urban centres which are accessed by very few people. Yet our people in the villages are left \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I want to ask the committee that will be formed here \\nand this House at large to look into laws that will enable the NHIF to create a proper working \\npolicy so that we are able to give services to the people in the villages.  \\n\\nThe  availability  of  medical  care,  medicines  and  medical  supplies  is  pegged  on  the \\navailability  and  order  fulfilment  rate  of  Kenya  Medical  Supplies  Authority  (KEMSA).  This \\ninstitution has been crippled by the unavailability of funds, and their turnaround time right now \\nis very low. All this is because KEMSA is supposed to have a budget, which it fills through its \\nown operations. This  House had seen it fit before to  allocate KEMSA some money so, that \\nprocurement of basic but very essential medical supplies are available to our people. I urge that \\nwe capitate this organisation so that our people have medical supplies available to them when \\nneeded. They should not die of very common illnesses and lack of proper healthcare.  \\n\\nI  also  want  to  talk  a  bit  on  importation.  Looking  in  this  House,  everything  here  has \\ncome from another country. We have a robust textile industry, if given proper support. This is \\nwhat will create employment to our people, because we cannot talk of development when we \\nhave a deficit payment which grew to US$2.5 billion last year.  For us to stop this, we must \\ncreate a tax regime that hampers importation of essential goods that can be manufactured here \\nand that encourages the manufacture of the same, so that we create employment and improve \\non our balance of payment. \\nWe also need to add value to our produce. Where I come from, we produce tea, coffee, \\n \\navocadoes and other agricultural  produce but  this produce  goes to  the market  at  a very low \\nvalue.   As a country, we are number one tea exporters; we control the world trade on tea. The \\ntea we export is probably worth about US$15 billion per year but we only benefit from 10 per \\ncent of it, which is US$1.5 billion per year. We must enable our people to add value to our \\nproduce.  Without value addition, we lose out on a lot of money as a country; money which is \\nrepatriated to other countries. That cannot be done if we do not reduce the bureaucracies around \\npackaging materials. The greatest impediment to value addition in the country is tax on value \\naddition produce and packaging materials for such produce and other produce. Again, we have \\na tax regime that hampers production because what should be taxed at consumption is taxed as \\ntrade.   \\n \\nhaving found me fit to represent them in this House and also to assure them\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  once  again,  I  want  to  thank  the  people  of  Gatundu  South  for \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. I now call upon the Member for Isiolo South. \\nHon. Bidu Mohamed (Isiolo South, JP): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for giving \\n\\nme this opportunity. My name is Mohamed Tubi Bidu from Isiolo South Constituency. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, I thank the Almighty God for giving me the opportunity to be here \\ntoday in this august  House. Secondly,  I thank the people of  Isiolo South  for  giving me this \\nopportunity to serve them. I vied last time and thought that I won but this time they elected me \\nand here I am. \\n\\nFor the benefit of doubt,  Isiolo South is located in Isiolo County and  Isiolo Town is \\ngeographically  the  centre  of  this  country.  It  is  the  border  and  gateway  into  the  harsh \\nenvironmental  conditions  of  northern  Kenya.  Isiolo  is  located  on  the  other  side  of  Mount \\nKenya. When we hear about Mount Kenya, we talk about the South, East and West of it and \\nwe do not talk of the North. That harsh environment of the Northern Kenya starts from Isiolo.   \\nThe people of Isiolo South asked me to pose a question; that is, my predecessors in the \\n11th  and  12th  Parliaments  have  been  on  record  as  the  worst  performers  in  this  National \\nAssembly in the sense that it is on record that they have never participated in debates in this \\nHouse. On their part, they placed the blame on the emeritus Speaker, Hon. Justin Muturi. I do \\nnot know if that is true but that is what they said. Because of that, I have to give a clear picture \\nof what Isiolo South is all about. Isiolo South borders Garissa, Wajir and Meru County. Meru \\nCounty which is our neighbour is well developed while Isiolo is known as the start of the many \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Education  wise,  it  is  amongst  the \\nconstituencies which have been lagging behind.   \\n\\nWe  have  a  good  Constitution  which  talks  about  opportunities  for  everyone.  Kenya \\nbelongs to all of us and we are all supposed to get equal opportunities of whatever is given out.  \\nThat is what we are lacking in Isiolo South and the entire North. The worst part of the drought \\nthat is now ravaging the country starts from Isiolo County. In Kenya, we have four kinds of \\npeople: the agriculturalists, who are farmers; the fishermen around the lakes; the urban settlers \\nand  the  pastoralists.  The  people  who  are  most  affected  by  the  drought  are  the  pastoralist \\ncommunities  who  have  received  very  minimal  support  from  the  successive  government \\nregimes. We hope that the new regime is going to focus on Isiolo South to the North because \\ndevelopment  is  lacking  in  these  areas.  All  the  infrastructure  we  see  in  our  neighbouring \\ncounties is not in Isiolo and beyond. \\n\\nOn the insecurity issue, Isiolo might be the gateway to northern Kenya but one may \\nthink it is the Kenyan boundary. This is because we have all the military installations in Isiolo \\ninstead of them being on the Kenyan border. This stretches over to Garissa and Turkana. Why \\nshould  we  have  military  installations  in  Isiolo,  which  are  supposed  to  be  at  the  country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nborder? This is why I attribute the insecurity in northern Kenya to some of the plans that were \\nmade  at  Independence,  where  military  installations  were  placed  at  the  centre  instead  of  the \\nborder. Isiolo is always faced with insecurity. Porous borders have been a big issue there.   \\n\\nIsiolo and the Northern Kenya region should to be changed by this regime. We have \\nbeen marginalised since Independence. We expect that with the Constitution something has to \\nchange.  However, with the way things are going, unless this is stopped, it is going to get worse.  \\nI am saying this because in the last Parliament, there was the issue of one man-one shilling-one \\nvote and we were being blamed for low population. You cannot blame us when we live in an \\nenvironment where it is a problem for women and men to reproduce compared to other areas \\nbecause of the harsh environmental conditions. The Leader of the Majority Party has been the \\nadvocate of the one-man one-shilling one-vote. We have to discard that and help one another \\nto develop. Counties which have been underdeveloped since Independence should be brought \\nup to the level of those counties that are developed so that the development is visible. I am \\npraying about this.  \\n\\nWe  have  land  matters  in  Isiolo.  The  Northern  Kenya  rangelands  are  still  under \\ncommunity  land,  which  is  supposed  to  belong  to  the  communities  of  that  county.  The \\ncommunities of that county are pastoralists and sometimes nomadic pastoralists. That does not \\nmean  that  there  are  no  people  in  those  rangelands.  They  are  there.  As  I  said  earlier,  the \\ninsecurity  that  has  been  happening  all  through  has  something  to  do  with  resources  and \\ndevelopment. We have to think about it. The current Government should at least change the \\nface of Northern Kenya, starting with Isiolo South and Isiolo North. That is the gateway to the \\nvast Northern Kenya.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  developments  have  come  up.  The  Lamu  Port-South  Sudan-\\nEthiopia-Transport (LAPSSET) project is coming up, amongst other big projects earmarked \\nfor  those  areas  but  are  we  getting  the  right  thing?  If  the  Chinese  who  have  been  given  the \\ncontracts bring their thousands of vehicles and casual labourers from outside to do the work, \\nare we getting our share?  That is the question we need to ask.  \\n\\nWith those few remarks, I thank the members of the public from Isiolo South who voted \\n\\nme in. I assure them that I will be there for them. \\n\\nHon. Omboko Milemba (Emuhaya, ANC): On a point of order, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: What is your point of order, Member for Emuhaya? \\nHon. Omboko Milemba (Emuhaya, ANC): Hon.

With all due \\nrespect, there is a procedure that we did not follow. There is a procedure we missed as a House.  \\nHon. Omboko Milemba requested for the Mover to be called upon to reply. The House should \\nhave first agreed with that. We thought that when you rose to put the Question, you were doing \\nso for the House to give authority to shorten the debate for the Mover to reply. That did not \\nhappen, and the Mover did not reply to the Motion. We could not proceed to vote on the Motion \\nbefore the Mover replied. Even before we go to the next Order, let us go back and correct the \\nprocedure on the previous Motion.  \\n\\nHon.

We have done \\nthat to  try to achieve  regional balance.  Hon. Joash Nyamoko  hails from the same  region  as \\nHon. Sylvanus Osoro. It is, indeed, important that the Whip be a member of the Committee on \\nSelection.  \\n\\nThe Majority and Minority leadership have had a lot of engagements with Members \\nseeking to be placed on certain committees. I have seen people queuing outside the office of \\nleader of the Minority Party, the same way people are queuing outside my office and the offices \\nof the Whip and the Deputy Leader of the Majority. It is good for Members to appreciate that, \\nunder the Standing Orders, this is  the Committee charged  with  the responsibility of placing \\nMembers on Committees. It is not the responsibility of the Leader of the Minority Party or the \\nLeader of the Majority Party. Members of this Committee are the ones that you need to engage \\nto place you on the committees of your choice. On the Majority side, we gave our Members \\nthe opportunity to list committees of their choice. \\n\\nI encourage my colleagues on the Minority side to organise themselves and have their \\nMembers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 list showing the committees they desire, so that when we get an opportunity to sit, \\nonce this Committee is approved by the House, we make our work easier in making a decision \\non a list that is agreed to by the Minority and Majority parties. It is a very tedious exercise and \\none that will take a lot of time. It will require us to balance various interests to be able to place \\nMembers on committees they are best suited for. I am sure all Members submitted their biodata \\nduring induction. We have copies of your curriculum vitae. So, we will be able to place you on \\ncommittees of your choice. We will endeavour to make sure that you are placed on committees \\nof your choice and those that are in line with your skills and competencies. \\n\\nI want to appeal to Members. The Majority side, for instance, has eight or so slots on \\nthe  Departmental  Committee  on  Transport  and  Infrastructure  yet  as  at  last  night  we  had \\nreceived requests from 79 Members who desire to be appointed to the Committee as their first \\nchoice. I know it is because of the challenges that Members have with roads and infrastructure \\nin their constituencies. I want to assure Members that as much as 79 Members of the Majority \\nParty  cannot  fit  on  that  one  Committee.  We  will  endeavour  to  find  the  eight  Members, \\nconsidering regional, ethnic and party balance and interest of Independent Members. All 79 \\nMembers in the Majority Party cannot fit in that one Committee. We will endeavour to list the \\neight who will be lucky. These are the ones whom the Committee on Selection will find suitable \\nto sit in that Committee. They will consider what we have done in this Committee. There will \\nbe regional, ethnic and party balance, including representation of our Independent Members. \\nWe see this in the Committee on Selection where Hon. Caroline Jeptoo Ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99elechei represents \\nthe Independent Members. Our small parties are also represented in this Committee. Therefore, \\nwe will take care of the interests of all Members. I want Members to trust that this Committee \\nwill  be  diligent,  fair  and  just  to  each  and  every  one  of  us,  to  make  sure  that  we  serve  in \\ncommittees where we will give our best to the service of our nation. \\n\\nHon. Members, as I have indicated, it may not be possible to place everybody in their \\nfirst-choice committees. However, we will endeavour to place you either in your first, second \\nor third choice. I encourage you to engage with Members of this Committee with time and also \\nbe very understanding. As I said, I also encourage the Leader of the Minority Party, together \\nwith  his  leadership,  to  hasten  to  get  the  list  of  Members  who  will  be  nominated  to  certain \\ncommittees, so that by the time we meet most of the ground work will have been done, and the \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Being a Member of Parliament, you have the opportunity to attend any \\ncommittee that you want to. Nobody can stop you. For instance, if you are a Member of the \\nDepartmental Committee on Transport and Infrastructure, nobody will stop you from attending \\nthe meeting of another committee. In line with our Standing Orders, you just need to notify the \\nChair in advance. If you want to attend meetings of the Budget and Appropriations Committee \\nor the Departmental Committee on Energy, nobody will stop you. If you have an interest, for \\ninstance, in water and irrigation\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I have seen that most of the Members have requested to be \\nin the Departmental Committee on Transport and Infrastructure, Budget and Appropriations \\nCommittee,  Departmental  Committee  on  Blue  Economy  and  Irrigation,  Departmental \\nCommittee  on  Health,  Departmental  Committee  on  Energy  and  the  Public  Accounts \\nCommittee (PAC). Nothing precludes you from attending those committees.  \\n\\nWhen Hon. Opiyo Wandayi was the Chair of the PAC, when many of us had a matter \\nthat we were interested in, we declared that interest and notified him. If a Cabinet Secretary \\nwill appear before the Departmental Committee on Transport and Infrastructure and you want \\nto articulate issues that relate to your constituency, under our Standing Orders, you are allowed \\nto  appear  before  it  with  just  a  simple  notice  to  the  Chair.  Therefore,  let  us  not  have  very \\nintransigent  positions that  you must be in  this or that committee. We should  appreciate that \\nwith the reduced numbers of committee membership after the changes in our Standing Orders, \\nthe  Minority  Party  side  in  most  committees  will  get  only  seven  Members.  Within  those \\nMembers,  they  must  accommodate  all  the  political  parties  within  the  Coalition  and  the \\nIndependent Members. Therefore, the numbers that we expect may not necessarily meet all our \\nexpectations. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I beg Members to quickly expedite this business of putting in \\nplace the Committee on Selection, so that by the time we come back from  the short recess, \\nwithout anticipating the afternoon business, we will have completed it. These Committees will \\nhave  a  lot  of  work.  I  hope  by  that  time  His  Excellency  the  President  will  have  nominated \\npersons  to  serve  as  Principal  Secretaries.  This  Committee  will  have  its  work  cut  out  in  the \\nvetting of the Principal Secretaries. When we say that we want to balance the membership of \\nthe  Committee,  it  is  with  the  understanding  that  we  also  need  both  ranking  and  seasoned \\nMembers and new Members in those committees to learn what goes on.  \\n\\nWith those very many remarks, Hon. Deputy Speaker, and again with the indulgence \\nof the Leader of Minority Party, I want to request the emeritus Leader of the Minority Party, \\nHon. John Mbadi, to second this Motion on behalf of the Leader of the Minority Party. \\n\\nI beg to move the Motion. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. John Mbadi. \\nHon.  John  Mbadi  (Nominated,  ODM):  The  Leader  of  the  Majority  Party  has  just \\n\\nambushed me. I least expected this.  \\n\\nLet me take this opportunity to second the Motion. I know that it is not an easy job. I \\nhave been here before. I served as the Leader of the Minority Party in the last Parliament. I \\nknow  how  difficult  it  is  to  really  balance-off  the  interests  of  Members.  The  Committee  on \\nSelection has a tough job. However, it will be helped by the Whip of the Majority Party, Whip \\nof the Minority Party, the Leader of the Majority Party and the Leader of the Majority Party. \\nSo, their work may not be so difficult because the leadership of both sides will have sat down \\nand balanced-off the interests of Members.  I  am  sure that both  sides will constitute a small \\ncommittee to look into this matter. I want to just urge for fairness.  \\n\\nFor whatever reason, some committees are considered to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery important\\xe2\\x80\\x99. In my \\nfirst term in this Parliament, all committees were almost the same. There was none that had \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

However, over time, it has grown that there are some committees \\nwhich are more attractive; like the Budget and Appropriations Committee, the Departmental \\nCommittee on Transport and Infrastructure, the Departmental Committee on Energy and the \\nDepartmental Committee on Finance and National Planning. My advice to this Committee is \\nto ensure that no Member sits in more than one of these committees. If you are in the PAC, \\nforego the Budget and Appropriations Budget, the Departmental Committee on Finance and \\nNational  Planning,  the  Departmental  Committee  on  Transport  and  Infrastructure  and  the \\nDepartmental Committee on Energy. Do not select a Member to be a member of both PAC and \\nthe Budget and Appropriations. No one can give you that. Honestly, if that list comes to this \\nHouse, Members will have a problem with it. I am sure that the leadership of both sides will \\nlook into this matter. \\n\\nAs I sit down, I just want to appreciate that the House has recognised that I am a ranking \\nMember. It has designated a special seat for me. I do not take it for granted. I want to thank the \\nHouse. I also encourage the leadership from my side to recognise the same. \\n\\nThank you. \\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: You are duly recognised. I will propose the Question.  \\n \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, I can see there are 53 requests from Members \\nwho have shown interest. As I said earlier in the morning, a maiden speech is a maiden speech \\nwhether  you do it now or next  year for the first time. The practice of the House  is to allow \\nMembers a little extra leeway in between debate to make their maiden speeches. Therefore, I \\nwill be asking Members to try not to make too many interventions in order to allow Members \\nto use this opportunity to make their maiden speeches.  \\n\\nI now call upon the Nominated Member, Hon. Bishop Jackson Kosgei.   \\nHon.  (Dr.)  Jackson  Kosgei  (Nominated,  UDA):  Thank  you  so  much,  Hon.  Deputy \\nSpeaker.  I begin  by  congratulating  you for being  elected the  Deputy Speaker of this august \\nHouse. I also extend the same to our Speaker, Hon. Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula, for being elected the Speaker \\nof  the  13th  Parliament.  I  also  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  all  Members  for  going \\nthrough rigorous election exercises and finally, by the grace of God, having an opportunity to \\nbe  in  this  august  House.  Above  all  and  on  behalf  of  members  of  our  society  living  with \\ndisabilities in one way or another, I recognise them. I express my greatest and deepest gratitude \\nto  constituencies  that  elected  Members  with  disabilities  in  this  country.  They  are  great.  I \\ncongratulate them for not seeing the physical, but the person and character of the individuals \\nthey elected.  \\n\\nI also thank and appreciate, most sincerely, my party, the United Democratic Alliance, \\nunder the leadership of His Excellency the President of our Republic, William Samoei Ruto. \\nHe  considered  me  among  others  to  represent  special  interest  groups  and  persons  with \\ndisabilities.  I  am  deeply  grateful  to  be  given  that  opportunity.  I  look  forward  to  my  life  in \\nParliament  in  the  next  five  years.  I  will  contribute  towards  improving  legislation  and \\nrepresenting the needs of persons with disabilities amongst others in this country.  \\n\\nAs I listened to the inaugural speech of our Speaker, he mentioned several Bills that \\nneed to be revived in the House. We looked at them. Some of the Bills we thought should have \\nbeen there include those that touch on persons with disabilities, one of which progressed from \\nthe last Parliament to the Senate and it is still there. We would like to have it looked at afresh. \\nSoon, we will approach your office. We had a meeting with the Kenya Disability Parliamentary \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Thanks to our Constitution. We intend to bring \\nto the attention of the House the need to have a re-look at our disability Acts, the national policy \\non persons with disabilities and the regulations, some of which are ambiguous in operation, \\nand have hampered the capacity to administrate and implement the Acts. We will be drawing \\nthe attention of the House to the same.  \\n\\nToday, as I make my Maiden Speech, I join colleagues who have contributed over the \\nlast  four  days  on  security.  Security  matters  are  one  of  the  contributing  factors  to  disability. \\nWhere there is war and insecurity, people are injured and we create more disabled persons in \\nthe  country.  I  appeal  that  may  be,  it  will  be  necessary  to  re-look  at  the  causes  and  issues \\nunderlining areas that have been unstable in our country. In the northern part, eastern, Coastal \\narea and the northern parts of the Rift Valley belt, there has to be concerted efforts by all the \\nleaders to look at the issue of cattle rustling as a menace that can be controlled. \\n\\nHaving lived, worked and participated in faith-based services in this country for over \\n40 years, I have concluded that cattle rustling requires more political goodwill than any other \\nmethod. The others are secondary. There has never been political goodwill at national and local \\nlevels. Perhaps, this House will consider at one point to re-introduce a Motion that will establish \\na taskforce of this Parliament to study and let people participate in contributing on the causes \\nand remedies towards insecurity, especially in areas that are affected in the communities.  \\n\\nWith this, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I thank you for giving me the opportunity. I have been \\ntrying since we started, but I think I was a bit analogue because there is a button I did not press. \\nI thought I could not see it. Thank you very much. May God bless you. \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  The  Member  for  Makueni  County  is  not  there.  Member  for \\n\\nWajir West.  \\n\\nHon. Yusuf Farah (Wajir West, ODM): Bismillahi. Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, \\n\\nfor giving me this opportunity to make my Maiden Speech in this House. \\n\\nAllow me to start by thanking the Almighty Allah who has given me this opportunity \\nto represent the people of Wajir West in this august House. I also congratulate you for being \\nelected the Deputy Speaker of this honourable House. I thank the people of Wajir West, from \\nWagalla-Ganyure Ward, Ademasajide Ward, Hadado-Athibohol Ward and Griftu-Arbajahan \\nWard for finding me fit to represent them in this august House. It is with humility and a deep \\nsense of appreciation to the electorate who sent me here that I will represent them in this 13th \\nParliament.   \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, Wajir West has its unique and specific challenges that no other \\nconstituency  is  facing  in  this  country.  Among  them  is  the  Wagalla  Massacre,  which  is  a \\nhistorical injustice that happened on 10th February 1984. This is where several innocent people \\nwere  rounded  up  and  put  in  an  airstrip  by  security  agencies  then.  Children  born  on  that \\nparticular day are around 40 years old today, and have gone through serious challenges in life. \\nThey grew up without fathers and probably their mothers were raped in the same massacre.  \\nThis massacre has been documented very well in many reports, including the Truth,  Justice \\nand  Reconciliation  Commission (TJRC) Report which gave a draft of recommendations to \\nthis country.  The only thing that was done was a blanket apology by the then President of the \\nRepublic  of  Kenya,  His  Excellency,  Uhuru  Muigai  Kenyatta  in  2015.    The  rest  of  the \\nrecommendations have been shelved in  the archives.   I  appeal  to  the Government  to  kindly \\nlook into it, get the recommendations and act on them. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, Wajir West also faces insecurity on a daily basis. In as much as \\nsecurity  agencies  are  trying  their  best,  they  are  overwhelmed  in  many  occasions  by  cattle \\nrustlers  and  other  thugs  who  have  commercialised  livestock  theft.  In  the  last  five  years,  50 \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c12th October 2022                       NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                               21 \\n\\npeople have been killed in Wajir West. These were innocent people who had committed no \\ncrime and were going on with their daily activities of looking after their animals. They were \\nbutchered,  killed,  maimed  and  their  animals  forcefully  taken.  No  inquiries,  arrests  or \\ninvestigations have been made concerning the said murders.  The Government has so far not \\nreturned back the livestock and neither have they investigated or  arrested  anyone on  all the \\natrocities that happened during that time.   \\n\\nRecently, cattle and camel were being stolen on a daily basis. Last night, 60 herds of \\ncamel were stolen and the man who was looking after them was injured. He is currently laying \\nin hospital and at the moment, we do not know his situation. I appeal to the Government to \\nfacilitate security agencies who have not been facilitated in terms of movement and personnel \\nto carry out their mandate. Security issues are depriving lives and livelihoods of the people of \\nWajir West.    \\n\\nThe people of Wajir West also face similar problems like other people from other parts \\nof  the  country.  These  include  poverty,  drought,  and  unemployment,  but  they  have  an  extra \\nburden of insecurity on their shoulders. They have a right to be protected. Their livestock and \\nproperty too should be protected as enshrined in the Constitution of Kenya. Security agencies \\nare  trying  their  best,  but  have  been  handicapped  in  terms  of  movement  and  personnel.  I, \\ntherefore, appeal to the Government of Kenya and specifically to the cabinet secretary who will \\nbe appointed after successfully undergoing vetting, to act upon my request as soon as he or she \\nresumes office. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, Wajir West also faces serious drought challenge. The drought \\nthat this country is facing is very serious and we are about to lose lives.  I do not know whether \\nour Standing Orders allow us to play some videos to demonstrate the seriousness of that issue \\nin this House.  I appeal to the President to kindly declare the issue of drought a national disaster \\nso that other agencies and international communities can chip in to assist the affected people \\nespecially in ASAL areas.    \\n\\n In conclusion, I want to thank the people of Wajir West for having faith in me, and for \\n\\nsending me to represent them in this august House. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.  \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Hon.  Members,  I  now  call  upon  Hon.  Hussein  Barre,  the \\n\\nMember for Tarbaj. \\n\\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): On a point of order. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Leader of the Majority Party, what is your point of order? \\nHon.  Kimani  Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah  (Kikuyu,  UDA):  Sorry,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker.  I  did  not \\nwant to interrupt  any of the maiden speeches. In as much as Members are  complaining that \\ntheir gadgets are changing the ordering, I have noticed that Members are trying to re-log, and \\nmaybe as a point of information, I want to inform our new Members that if they remove their \\ncards or press the microphone button and it goes off, it will then relegate them down.  That is \\nwhy many of them were saying they were number 15 but fell down to number 30. The reason \\nis just because they are re-logging and pressing the microphone button to get your attention.   \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, now that I am on my feet, and since you did recognise pupils \\nfrom Genesis Academy, Kikuyu Constituency, I also take this opportunity to appreciate their \\npresence and welcome them to the National Assembly.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  this  is  one  of  our  best  performing  schools  in  the  Republic  of \\nKenya. In 2019, it is the school that produced the top boy who is now a student in my former \\nschool,  Alliance  High  School.  I  want  to  encourage  the  students  who  are  here  from  Genesis \\nSchool to put in their best effort and work hard as we look forward to the success of those who \\nwill be sitting for their Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) this year. I wish them \\nall the best. Those who desire to join Alliance High School, have examples to follow like Andy \\nMichael, who was the best student from that school in 2019.

Deputy Speaker. \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Hon.  Members,  my  apologies  to  the  Member  for  Tarbaj.  I \\n\\n \\nactually have the Leader of the Minority Party who is before you and you are the next.  \\n\\nHon. Leader of the Minority Party, before you get your turn, l have just been notified \\nabout the students of Uthiru who are behind me and so, I cannot actually see them. Therefore, \\nI  wish  to  recognise,  in  the  Public  Gallery,  the  presence  of  teachers  and  pupils  from  Uthiru \\nGenesis  School  from  Kikuyu  Constituency,  Kiambu  County.  On  behalf  of  the  House,  I \\nwelcome them as they follow the proceedings of the National Assembly. Thank You.  \\n\\nLet us have the Leader of the Minority Party. \\n \\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I actually \\ndid not want to say much on this matter. I would like to welcome the Uthiru Genesis School \\nfrom the great Kikuyu Constituency. It is a constituency that I have fond memories of because \\nit is home to the great Alliance High School.   \\n\\nAllow  me  to  say  one  or  two  things  just  to  echo  what  had  been  said  earlier  by  my \\ncolleague, Hon. Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah. This is perhaps one of the most difficult times for leadership in \\nthe House. I have been blessed to be here since 2013 and I can tell you, for the times that I have \\nwitnessed  the  happenings  during  and  around  the  time  of  placement  of  Members  into \\ncommittees, I can confirm that this is one of the most difficult times. Why do I say so? You \\nwill  find  a  familiar  pattern  more  or  less  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  by  Members  essentially \\nnarrowing down to not more than ten particular committees. You will find that these are the \\ncommittees  of  choice  to  nearly  three  quarters  of  Membership.  For  instance,  on  the  side  of \\nAzimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition Party, we find that we have well over 100 Members \\nwho have expressed interest to be placed in the Budget and Appropriations Committee against \\nplacement opportunities of not more than 12. This obviously goes a long way to indicate or to \\nshow how difficult the task is to decide who to place there and who to leave out.  \\n\\nAll Members should understand that even if your committee of choice is X, Y or Z and \\nyou  end  up  not  getting  placement  in  your  committee  of  choice,  you  should  take  the \\ndisappointment in stride knowing well that being left out is not on account of lack of experience \\nor skills. You are not any less qualified to belong to that particular committee than those who \\nhave been placed there. That should be the guiding principle. Eventually, the most important \\nthing is that in line with what the Standing Orders dictate, every single Member of this House \\nwill be selected to, at least, one committee. In some cases, Members will be selected to two \\ncommittees.  \\n\\nAs you also know, following the amendment to the Standing Orders at the tail end of \\nthe  last  Parliament,  the  number  of  committees  have  increased  even  though  the  number  of \\nMembers  in  these  committees  has  decreased.  Every  single  Member  will  have  a  chance  to \\nbelong to a committee or two. I would like to reiterate the fact that each and every committee \\nof this House is as important as the other. It all depends on what use you put the committees \\ninto including how well you oversee the respective departments,  engage with  the Executive \\nand engage with  the people who are the ultimate consumers of our work.  Ultimately,  each \\ncommittee should satisfy the needs and interests of all of us.  \\n\\nWithout  belaboring  the  point,  my  plea  to  all  Members  is  that  even  as  we  navigate \\nthrough this process, let us try to be as cooperative and understanding as possible, so that we \\ncan get over it as quickly and smoothly. This will allow committees to get down to work and \\ndeliver for the people of Kenya.  \\n\\nWith those many remarks I support. I thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. We will now have the Member for Tarbaj.

I think it is \\nbetter if you present your names to the Clerk. \\n\\n Proceed, Member for Tarbaj \\nHon. Hussein Abdi (Tarbaj, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me \\nthis opportunity to address this House. I come from Tarbaj Constituency, which is within Wajir \\nCounty that boarders Mandera and Somalia on the eastern side. I would like to congratulate the \\nSpeaker and yourself for being elected to preside over the business of this House. I thank the \\npeople of Tarbaj Constituency and all who supported me. They sent me here to represent them \\nand present their issues to the nation. I do not want to forget those who were supporting the \\nother contestants as now I represent them all.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  Tarbaj  Constituency  has  a  lot  of  challenges,  but  the  greatest \\nchallenge currently is drought. My constituents are losing their livestock and some are on the \\nverge of losing their lives because of lack of water. Our people cannot do their work. They are \\nsuffering due to the vagaries of nature. They do not have water. They call me to supply them \\nwith water, which I cannot. Currently, Tarbaj Constituency is suffering bad drought. I know \\nefforts are being done by the Government headed by our President, Dr. William Ruto, and his \\nDeputy.  They  are  putting  in  some  effort,  but  that  is  not  enough.  I  expect  that  allocation  of \\nmoney for rigs and a number of dams will be done in the coming budget so that, for once, we \\ncan  address  the  issue  of  water  in  my  constituency.  This  is  one  thing  that  has  always  been \\ncoming back. I hope in this term, we will find a solution for this. I wish to engage Members of \\nthe specific committees who are going to deal with sectoral areas that are concerned with water. \\nWe will give a lot of preference to this issue this time, so that such challenges can be addressed.  \\nAnother thing that is a result of that situation is unemployment. There is unemployment \\nin my constituency because people depend on livestock which is now decimated due to drought. \\nWe  are  not  connected  to  the  national  grid,  which  have  enhanced  start-ups  of  factories  and \\nindustries.  We  are  also  experiencing  the  least  connectivity  index  in  terms  of  roads.  This \\nsituation has created an environment where jobs are not being created and quite a number of \\nmy  people  are  not  employed.  During  this  term,  I  expect  that  the  road  from  Modagashi  to \\nMandera will be tarmacked so that business can be enhanced, and the national grid is connected \\nfrom Garissa to Mandera, so that industries can be set up by private citizens and jobs creation \\nrejuvenated. This is a bother to my people and I hope it will be addressed.  \\n\\nAnother thing that my constituency experiences is environmental problems. This is an \\nera  where  climate  change  is  a  debate  in  the  whole  world.  My  constituency,  being  a  dry \\nconstituency that does not have electricity connectivity, and people depend largely on the few \\nshrubs that exist for fire and energy, they are forced to collect firewood from wherever they \\nfind.  That  exacerbates  the  drought  situation  in  my  area.  I  hope  with  the  focus  in  electricity \\nconnectivity, special consideration will be given to certain companies to introduce the usage of \\ngas. In my constituency, I want to allocate some little money to some people who will provide \\ngas energy and teach my people how to use it so that they can lessen the use of firewood. I \\nhope the ministry concerned will also join me in encouraging the people and extend that service \\nto  my  constituency  so  that  pressure  on  firewood  is  lessened.  I  also  want  the  Ministry  of \\nEnvironment  and  other  ministries  concerned,  especially  the  Ministry  of  Energy,  to  help  me \\nrecruit  a  number  of  young  men  as  environmental  guards  so  that  they  can  be  diverted  from \\ncollecting  firewood  or  cutting  the  few  trees  that  we  have  and  are  meaningfully  engaged  on \\nemployment to guard those ones.  These are some of the issues.  \\n\\nAnother issue that is of concern to my constituency is the education sector. As they say, \\nif you want to interfere with the progress of a society, play around with education. You will \\nfind schools with close to 700 students with only one or two teachers in my constituency. That \\nis widespread in the northern area. I know in the last term, a number of Members of Parliament \\nhad a number of initiatives to improve that by taking up a proposal with the Teachers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Service \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Quite a number of teachers are \\nrecruited from across the country, but when they get there, and are accepted as teachers, they \\ngive excuses of the place being inhospitable because of insecurity and such things. Those are \\njust excuses. Sadly, that is accepted by the TSC. I hope this does not happen. The TSC should \\nrecruit teachers from that area and the qualifications pegged on teachers should not apply to \\ncertain extent in those areas, so that local teachers can be employed.  \\n\\nAnother issue is access to citizenship documents by my constituents, namely, identity \\ncards  and  passports.  A  week  ago,  I  was  pursuing  a  case  where  a  young  man  from  my \\nconstituency, who is qualified in every way, was following me for almost two weeks so that I \\ncould facilitate him being issued with a passport. When I took up the matter, I was told it is the \\nintelligence  officers  who  verify  whether  he  is  a  Kenyan  or  not.  I  had  to  follow  up  and \\nintelligence people had no problem and have given him a go-ahead. But it took a lot of time \\nfor that information to be given even with the advanced technology. I know with the Integrated \\nPopulation  Registration  System  (IPRS)  in  place  and  the  Huduma  Number  that  we  have \\nregistered, this verification from the ground should not take place anymore. This information \\nshould be at the fingertips of immigration officers. I consulted the Director and he said he is \\ndoing  something  about  it.  I  hope  that  is  going  to  work.  I  do  not  want  any  more  of  my \\nconstituencies running after me for basic rights like identity cards.   \\n\\nAnother challenge that I have is security because I border Somalia. My constituency \\ngets a lot of incursion from an illegal group that operates in Somalia. I want some facilities like \\nsub-counties established so that I can get enough security personnel to beef up security in my \\narea.  \\n\\nI know I will have more time to speak and that is what I wish to say for now. Thank \\n\\nyou.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Kiambu County. \\nHon Ann Wamuratha (Kiambu County, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for \\ngiving me this opportunity to make my Maiden Speech. My name is Ann Muratha, the Woman \\nRepresentative for Kiambu County. I first want to take this opportunity to congratulate you on \\nyour  election  as  Deputy  Speaker  of  this  House  and  also  congratulate  Hon.  Speaker  for  his \\nelection  too.  I  also  want  to  congratulate  our  President  for  giving  us  leadership  during  the \\ncampaigns and allowing us to get the opportunity to be elected by the people. I personally want \\nto thank the people of Kiambu for believing in me and giving me thousands of their votes to \\ncome  and  represent  them  in  this  august  House.  I  am,  indeed,  very  grateful  for  the  12 \\nconstituencies  in  Kiambu  County  and  the  60  wards  that  believed  in  me  and  gave  me  their \\nthousands of votes. I want to assure them that I am going to represent them in this House, and \\nthat God giving me his grace, I will serve all of them as is the wish I had when I requested them \\nto give me their votes. \\n\\nThere is an issue that I have been thinking about in this House where we have come \\nfrom elections and we have so many people with so many issues. There are people who still do \\nnot believe they lost elections. I want our people to know and to understand that the situation \\nthe country is in after the election season is not good. People are suffering out there. People are \\ntired of politics and nonsensical dramas. All that people want are leaders to now work for them, \\nregardless of their political parties. We have to understand that we have to come together for \\nthe  sake  of  our  country.    I  get  irritated  when  I  see  some  people  who  believe  being  in  the \\nOpposition  means  fighting  everything  that  the  Government  is  doing.    My  prayer  is  that  we \\nwork  together.  I  would  like  us  to  work  together.  I  want  to  raise  the  issue  of  illicit  brew  in \\nKiambu, which has destroyed young people.  I want us to look into such issues as a House. Let \\nus see how we can help the counties that are going through such problems.   \\n\\nI also want us to talk about mental wellness.  Our people are killing one another every \\nday.  Members  of  families  are  dying  every  day:  husbands  killing  wives  and  children  thus \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

We need to be sitting together as Kenyan leaders to speak on behalf \\nof our people. We must come up with ways of developing centres that will take care of mental \\nhealth. We should be able to help officers serving in the forces, say, Kenya Defence Forces \\n(KDF) and the National Police Service (NPS), who are killing one another.  We need to address \\nissues affecting them and ultimately be of help to them.  \\n\\n I would also like to thank the people of Azimio La Umoja, One Kenya Coalition Party. \\nYesterday Baba decided to go to the people as the people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leader. He visited their \\xe2\\x80\\x98parliament\\xe2\\x80\\x99.  \\nI think that is the right way to go and that is where the Azimio La Umoja, One Kenya Coalition \\nParty belongs to.  Let him understand what people want out there and then tell us what we need \\nto do for our people instead of fighting us. We do not have another country. All of us need to \\nstand for what is right in this country regardless of which party we belong to. I would want to \\nrequest all of us to move on.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  I  thank  our  President  so  much  for  addressing  the  issue  of \\nremoving  people  from  Credit  Reference  Bureaus  (CRBs).  There  are  some  people  who  are \\nunable to pay off their debts because of the economic situation in the country. Those who were \\nunable to pay were blacklisted together with those who do not pay their debts at all. They are, \\ntherefore,  referred  to  as  defaulters.    I  thank  the  President  for  giving  these  people  a  second \\nchance  to  enable  them  access  loans.    Where  I  come  from,  people  believe  in  working  for \\nthemselves and earning their own money. That can only be done through access to small loans. \\nI have seen the boy-child resorting to suicidal tendencies whenever they lack money.  I would \\nalso  like  to  request  the  Government  to  avoid  borrowing  locally  so  that  it  can  also  give  our \\npeople the opportunity to get loans from the banks. \\n\\nFinally, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to make one humble request and pray that \\nwe work as a team.  I want to make a humble prayer as a mother, wife and a citizen of this \\ncountry to our people in Azimio la Umoja, One Kenya Coalition Party to accept that the country \\nhas to move on. They should accept that our President is none other than William Samoei Ruto. \\nThey need to believe and live with that.  They also need to give the President time to work. He \\nis not a robot. It is only a month now since he took office.  They need to give the President time \\nto organise the country. They need to move on.   \\n\\nI  would  also  like  to  request  that,  as  a  House,  we  accept  the  appointed  Cabinet \\nSecretaries,  particularly  Moses  Kuria.  I  pray  that  we  get  into  the  momentum  of  working \\ntogether and the likes of Moses Kuria get  appointed. He will be in charge of industries and \\nmanufacturing. I am sure he will enable the youth to get opportunities.  We have many youths \\nlanguishing  in  poverty  and  they  need  to  hear  from  us.    As  we  support  the  President,  let  us \\nsupport the Cabinet that he is bringing in, so that our people can move on.  Above all, let us \\nthink about the youth who are jobless so that they can get opportunities to earn a living.   \\n\\nThank you. May God bless you and may God bless Kenya. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Luanda. \\nHon. Dick Oyugi (Luanda, DAP-K): Thank you so much, Hon. Deputy Speaker. This \\nis my very first time to speak in this august House and, probably, it would be right to declare \\nmy presence.  My name is Dickson Maungu, newly elected Member of Parliament for Luanda.  \\n I take this opportunity to thank the people of Luanda for trusting me and having found \\nit fit that I represent them in this prestigious House.  I have been on the queue for the last four \\nor so days waiting to speak, but I think I was meant to speak today.  Allow me to congratulate \\nyou on your election as the Deputy Speaker. I would also like to congratulate our good Hon. \\nSpeaker in absentia.  I take this opportunity to sincerely thank the people of Luanda for having \\ntrusted me as their Member of Parliament in this prestigious House. It was my first attempt and \\nout of great respect, they found it fit that I represent them.  I thank the great women and men \\nof Luanda who woke up very early in the morning to cast their votes, and more so, in my favour \\nas their Member of Parliament.   \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I ran my campaign on a platform \\nof change and transformation.  I believe that during my reign as the Member of Parliament for \\nLuanda Constituency, I will be able to champion my people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interests and represent them in a \\nbefitting manner. Luanda experiences a huge challenge in terms of youth unemployment.  We \\nhave many young people who are unemployed and this remains an issue of concern just like it \\nis for the rest of the country.   \\n\\nWe  also  have  issues  to  do  with  infrastructure.  During  my  campaign,  I  had  an  ISC \\nAgenda.  I  championed  infrastructure,  which  is  a  very  important  component  for  any  kind  of \\ndevelopment to happen in any given place in this country.  We have two important roads in \\nLuanda which I desire that in due course should be completed.  We have Maseno-Kombewa \\nRoad which began more than eight  years ago but  is  incomplete.    I believe  I  will be able to \\nchampion the same and ensure that it is completed so that it becomes of great use to the people.  \\nThis road cuts across three counties and three sub-counties, that is, Luanda, Rarieda and Seme. \\nThe road began from  Seme but  for some  reason  stopped when it reached  Luanda.   It  is  my \\nprayer that we find out the reasons behind the stalling of construction of the road and ensure \\nthat it is completed.  We equally have a very important infrastructure, which is the road that \\nconnects  Luanda  to  Mbale.  I  will  seek  to  ensure  that  in  partnership  with  the  national \\nGovernment, this road is completed in record time.   \\n\\nI  also  have  an  agenda  on  security,  which  is  a  matter  of  concern  across  the  country. \\nInsecurity has very much affected the business community in Luanda Constituency, which has \\nfive gazetted police stations. Out of the five, only one was constructed many years ago. It is \\nmy prayer that during my reign, we will improve security in the constituency. We will strive \\nto put up a modern police station and fully deploy an Officer Commanding Station (OCS) there. \\nHe or she will ensure security in the area is improved more so for the business community and \\nthe general population in Luanda Constituency.  \\nI had an agenda on education, which is dear to me. Luanda Constituency covers a small \\n \\narea of land. I believe the only way we can empower our people is by ensuring they have access \\nto bursaries and are well supported in matters education. This will improve their welfare and \\nenable them to be self-employed or even create employment. Therefore, I will seek to ensure \\nthat the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institute, which we desired \\nto have many years ago, is brought to fruition.  I intend to pursue this with relevant Government \\nauthorities.  \\n\\nI have one more important issue which I need to bring to your attention and it is about \\nempowerment. You find with the high unemployment rate in our country, the only way we can \\nbridge the gap between the rich and poor people is by ensuring people are well empowered. \\nThe current administration has a fund referred to as the Hustlers Fund. This country has many \\nother  funds  like  Uwezo  Fund,  Women  Enterprise  Development  Fund,  Youth  Enterprise \\nDevelopment Fund (YEDF) and here comes the Hustlers Fund. It is my prayer that this fund \\nwill go a long way in empowering the mama mbogas, and boda boda people so they can feed \\nand take care of their families.  \\n \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  going  to  the  Order  of  the  day,  which  is  the  Motion  on  the \\nCommittee on Selection, I have a few things to say. It is true, as rightly put by Members who \\nspoke before me, that there are very many Members who have  chosen specific committees. \\nThe notion out here is that committees have got weight in the sense there are those which are \\nmore important than others.  \\n\\nI believe that as Members of this prestigious House, we should ensure there is fairness, \\nequity and representation. For example, looking at names of Members brought forward in this \\ncommittee of five people, I fail to see a Member who will articulate issues under the Azimio la \\nUmoja, One Kenya Coalition Party umbrella. How will they stand out and represent a small \\nparty in the name of Democratic Action Party Kenya (DAP-K)? Therefore, it is my prayer that \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It may not make \\nmuch  sense,  for  example,  for  a  Member  to  be  in  a  committee  where  he  will  have  little  to \\ncontribute.  One  would  rather  put  his  experience  or  expertise  to  great  use  in  an  appropriate \\ncommittee. That way, we will all contribute to the development of this nation.  \\n\\nMy  prayer  is  that  as  this  Committee  sits  down,  it  should  gel  the  more  experienced \\npeople  referred  to  as  the  ranking  Members  with  the  newly  elected  Members.  The  ranking \\nMembers will bring in their wealth of experience and the new Members will bring in new ideas \\nand philosophies. This way, I believe we shall have committees with good representation to \\nprovide oversight. In the current system of Government, only this House can provide oversight. \\nIt can only do so if we have men and women of integrity and of unquestionable character to \\nchampion the rights of the people and their interests. This can only happen by having in place \\ncommittees which are ably represented in this House. \\n\\n Hon. Deputy Speaker, I therefore wish to conclude by saying that I support the names \\nas indicated. I pray that the committees will provide a fair way for everybody for they represent \\nthe people who sent them here.  \\n\\nThank you very much. Asante sana. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Mosop Constituency. \\nHon. Abraham Kirwa (Mosop, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. First of all, \\nallow me to thank you for the opportunity you have given me. I also want to thank God for this \\nopportunity because I realise it was by His grace that I made it to this House. I ran against all \\nodds, for example, having to come from diaspora to run for office. It was not easy.  \\n\\nHon.  Gladys  Boss,  allow  me  to  congratulate  you  as  well  for  being  elected  Deputy \\nSpeaker  of  the  National  Assembly.  I  also  congratulate  Hon.  Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula  for  being  elected \\nSpeaker of the National Assembly. Allow me to thank the people of Mosop for giving me this \\nopportunity to represent them. We had nine aspirants but God gave me an opportunity to lead. \\nI assure them that we will accomplish much together. There were several promises we made to \\nthe people of Mosop. I want to assure them that we will continue working together in order to \\nachieve much. Mosop is an agricultural constituency and 80 per cent of its people depend on \\nagriculture. I want to believe that in the next five years we will focus on sugarcane, maize, tea \\nand coffee farming. This is because Mosop Constituency purely depends on agriculture. I thank \\nthe President for the fertiliser subsidy he introduced a few weeks ago.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I want to touch on an issue the President mentioned in his speech \\nabout Kenyan citizens living in the diaspora. For a very long time, Kenyans in diaspora have \\nbeen neglected. They contribute over Kshs285 billion to the economy of this country, but they \\nare not represented. For sure, their rights have been neglected. I want to believe in the next five \\nyears, I will represent their interests in this House. We can consider having diaspora as a county \\nor  constituency  so  that  they  elect  a  person  or  be  given  a  nomination  slot.  It  is  so  that  their \\ninterests can get represented here. There is an issue which has continuously been raised in the \\ndiaspora that they only send money but when it comes to embassies representing their interests, \\nthey do not.  \\n\\nWe have an embassy in Washington DC, but there are Kenyans living in different places \\nwho are unable to go to this embassy. For example, Kenyans living in Dallas and Georgia have \\nto go all the way to Washington DC to, say, renew their passports and address their issues. It \\nis very expensive for them to do that. We want to ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to consider \\nopening several consulates in various parts of foreign countries like in United States of America \\n(USA), Australia, United Kingdom (UK) or any other country where Kenyans are living. I hope \\nthe Ministry will consider doing that.  \\n\\nI thank the President because he came up with the Ministry of Diaspora even though it \\nis not a Ministry by itself, but a docket. Probably, they might appoint a Principal Secretary (PS) \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

There are many  Kenyans struggling \\nlike those in Saudi Arabia or the Middle East. This issue has been brought to this House many \\ntimes. What can we do to make sure the interests of these Kenyans, when they go out of this \\ncountry, are protected?  \\n\\nThe Government has been reluctant in monitoring and supervising agencies which send \\npeople outside the country. I know there are laws that monitor agencies but they are reluctant \\nto make sure Kenyans in the diaspora are protected. So, I hope we will have a Bill in this House \\nwhich will protect the rights of Kenyans. We have seen abuse of people on audios and videos. \\nSeveral concerns have been raised but nobody has taken the matter very seriously.  I believe \\nthat in the next few years, we will be able to address the issues of Kenyans who live abroad. I \\nassure them that for the time I will be here, I will represent their issues. We will raise these \\nissues  and  come  up  with  Bills  that  will  protect  them.  It  is  because  we  want  our  sisters  and \\nbrothers who go out of the country to be given the opportunity to do the best they can. We, \\ntherefore, must ensure that they are protected as well.  \\n\\nFor the people of Mosop, we have had insecurity issues along the Nandi Escarpment \\nborder with the Western and Nandi regions. I assure them that in the next few days, we will \\nhold a meeting so that we can address the issue of the border. I had a chance to discuss with a \\nneighbouring  Member  of  Parliament  why  we  should  continue  having  insecurity  along  the \\nNandi Escarpment. We all know where the border lies. Why has the Government not effected \\nit so that we do away with neighbours fighting along the Nandi Escarpment border?  \\n\\nThe other issue that I want to address is that of low income housing that the President \\nmentioned. He said that in the next few months or years, he will make sure that almost every \\nKenyan has an opportunity to own a home. In Mosop, we do not have major shopping centres \\nor towns, but we want to make sure that our people also benefit and own homes. So, I believe \\nthat the Ministry will sit down and figure that out. Other than the cities, which are Nairobi, \\nEldoret and others, how will the people in rural areas benefit from this programme? If we are \\nsaying that we will try to make sure that everybody owns a home, there has to be a programme \\nthat will help my people in Mosop to own homes at a cheaper price. I believe that we will sit \\ndown and discuss these issues.   \\n\\nThirdly, is the issue of digital currency. For a very long time, the rest of the world has \\nmoved to legalise digital currency. The United States of America (USA), Nigeria and several \\nother countries have done the same. I intend to bring a Bill to the Floor of this House to help \\nus  legalise  digital  currency.  This  is  something  that  we  really  need  to  discuss  and  get  into \\nbecause  if  the  world  is  moving  and  becoming  digital,  the  issue  of  digital  money  should  be \\naddressed. We should legalise it through the Central Bank of Kenya.  \\n\\nWith that, I thank you again for the opportunity. I have really tried to get an opportunity \\nto contribute for the last four days. I am always the first one to come in and the last to leave, \\nyet I do not get a chance to address issues. I thank you for this opportunity. I thank the people \\nof Mosop. Have a wonderful day.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you, Member for Mosop. Before I call upon the Member \\n\\nfor Nambale, followed by the Member for Chepalungu, I have an announcement.  \\n\\nHon. Members, I wish to recognise the presence of staff and students of the Nairobi \\nLeadership Academy from South C, Lang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ata Constituency of Nairobi County in the Public \\nGallery. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\n\\nOn behalf of the House, I welcome them as they follow the proceedings of the National \\n\\nAssembly.

Geoffrey Mulanya (Nambale, Independent): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, \\nfor  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  make  my  maiden  speech.  For  the  benefit  of  my  fellow \\nMembers, my name is Geoffrey Mulanya, the Independent Member of Parliament for Nambale \\nConstituency.  \\n\\nFirst, I thank you and congratulate you on your election as the Deputy Speaker of this \\nHouse.  Secondly,  I  thank  the  great  people  of  Nambale  for  electing  me  as  their  Member  of \\nParliament despite the difficult circumstances prevailing at the time. It was not easy to make it \\nin Nambale as an Independent Member. I do not take this for granted. There are reasons the \\npeople of Nambale saw it fit to elect me to this House. Those are issues I advanced to them that \\ntouch  on  their  livelihoods,  particularly  the  issue  of  electricity,  road  network,  agriculture, \\neducation and water supply.   \\n\\nLet me first address the issue of electricity supply. We have a serious problem whereby \\nelectricity supply is not stable. This has greatly affected our people, especially the youth who \\ndepend on it for their livelihoods. I implore the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum to look into \\nthe  issue  because  we  have  prolonged  power  blackouts  that  last  for  as  long  as  12  hours  in \\nNambale Constituency. We do not understand this common occurrence that has prevailed for \\nmore than four years now. We really hope that the matter will be addressed with the urgency \\nthat it deserves.  \\n\\nOn health, I am aware that the health function is a devolved one. However, I implore \\nmy fellow Members to look into it. Letting health to remain a devolved function has led to the \\nsuffering of our people. You will find that the allocation given to counties is not adequate to \\naddress health issues. For instance, in Nambale, we have one of the oldest health centres that \\nhas  been  elevated  to  a  Level  3  Hospital.  It  is  supposed  to  be  a  Level  4  Hospital  given  the \\npopulation of the people of Nambale.  \\n\\nBesides that, we need to address the issue of the health policy.  Since 2013 when we \\nintroduced the devolved functions, I have observed and noted that the health department has \\nstagnated in growth. There is no progression in terms of health services being offered to our \\npeople. You will find that health facilities are still at the same level they were in even before \\ndevolution was introduced in the country. I will be urging fellow Members to really look into \\nthe health issue and properly analyse it, so that we determine whether it should be fully left to \\nthe devolved units or not.   \\n\\nOn agriculture, the people of Nambale depend on agriculture at the rate of 80 per cent \\nas it is the backbone of their economy. I am happy that in his speech, the President emphasised \\non supporting farmers, so that they contribute to the growth of the economy. On that note, he \\npromised  to  follow  up  on  the  issue  of  subsidised  fertilisers.  The  difficulty  the  people  of \\nNambale  are  facing  is  that  one  of  accessing  subsidised  fertilisers.  You  will  note  that  the \\nfertilisers are channelled through the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB). The people \\nof Nambale do not have the benefit of having an NCPB branch near them. The nearest ones are \\nin  Bungoma  and  Malaba.  Now,  Bungoma  is  80  kilometres  away  and  farmers  are  really \\nhampered in accessing the commodity. The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries \\nshould deem it fit to ensure that subsidised fertilisers are distributed through the constituencies \\nor sub-counties so that,  as representatives, we can help farmers access them. We could also \\nregister them for distribution.  \\n\\nThe  road  network  is  another  challenge  really  affecting  the  growth  of  our  great \\nconstituency. We have one tarmacked road only from Mumias to Busia Town. We have two \\nother key roads that connect the constituency, that is, the Butula-Malaba Road and the Mumias-\\nMianga-Kimaeti Road. These roads are very key in supporting the businesses of the people of \\nNambale so that they can access the market to sell their produce. From 1990, we have never \\nhad expansion of road network in the constituency. I believe that the current government will \\nlook at the issue and ensure that Nambale also benefits from the national cake. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I implore the Teachers Service Commission  (TSC) to ensure that it employs more \\nteachers and deploys them in schools in Nambale. I was in the constituency last weekend and \\none of the schools\\xe2\\x80\\x94Majimbo Primary School, with a population of 800 students\\xe2\\x80\\x94only has \\nnine teachers! That number is quite low! We believe that the Ministry will look at the issue so \\nthat we can have enough teachers deployed in the constituency.  \\n \\nThere is great concern about Ebola. Nambale Constituency is close to the Busia border. \\nLast  week  the  Ministry  of  Health  discovered  two  suspected  cases  which  turned  out  to  be \\nnegative, but we cannot take the disease for granted. I call upon the Ministry of Health to work \\nclosely with Busia County Government so that they can deploy enough qualified personnel to \\ndo proper screening of the people entering the country through the Busia border. The people \\nare  greatly  apprehensive  that  if  this  issue  is  not  addressed,  we  may  end  up  having  another \\npandemic in the constituency. \\n\\nOn the issue of farming, I am happy that when the President paid a visit to the great \\ncounty of Homa Bay, he talked about cotton farming. Nambale is one of the constituencies that \\nhave been farming cotton in this country. It even has a defunct cotton ginnery. If the Ministry \\nof Agriculture and Livestock revives cotton farming, Nambale should be one of the areas to be \\nconsidered. This is because it is an area that was previously doing very well in cotton farming. \\nWe believe that this particular cash crop will help the people improve their economy.  \\n\\nWith  those  few  remarks,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  I  thank  you  for  giving  me  the \\n\\nopportunity to make my maiden speech in this House. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Chepalungu Constituency. \\nHon. Victor Koech (Chepalungu, CCM): Thank you so much, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nI am a new Member. You remember I have been to your desk several times. I came here with \\nthe knowledge that any time I want to speak I will speak on the Floor of the House, but I have \\nsince learnt that resilience pays. That is why I am here. \\n\\nFirst, I want to congratulate you, like my colleagues who spoke earlier, on your election \\nas the Deputy Speaker. We believe and trust in you and that you will serve us equally. I want \\nto  say  many  things.  Congratulations  to  the  Kenya  Kwanza  team  and  to  the  President.  I \\ncongratulate and appreciate the great people of Chepalungu for having faith and trust in me. It \\nhas been a journey that started a long time ago. For them to have one of their own, a child born \\nand bred in the same constituency, being a Member of Parliament is a great achievement. \\n\\nI thank my party that sponsored me to this House. Against all odds, I am a Member of \\nParliament  through  CCM  party.  You  all  know  that  there  was  a  wave  in  the  country. \\nNonetheless, the people of my constituency saw it fit to elect me as their Member. Our main \\naim to be here is to debate issues and to make progress. It is not about winning. Hon. Deputy \\nSpeaker, I want to make a few comments. I will try my best to be brief and stick to the point. \\n \\nI want to speak about the poor road network in my constituency. Before 2013, I want \\nto report to this House, we had zero kilometres of tarmac road. Nonetheless, we benefited from \\na project that was launched in 2015. We were connected to a tarmac road that was poorly done. \\nI want to believe that it was not up to the standard that the people of Chepalungu expected. I \\nrecommend  that  in  future  this  House  should  ensure  proper  consideration  in  terms  of  the \\nstandards  of  roads  that  we  give  to  the  various  constituencies.  We  come  from  different \\ngeographical areas, therefore, there are different types of soils for different areas.  I  thank  the \\nGovernment for giving us the second road that serves Kyogong-Sigor all the way to Chebunyo \\nand Kaboson. We were about to celebrate, but along the way the contractor left the site and up \\nto now we are yet to see him! I have made several attempts to visit the relevant offices but in \\nvain. We believe that the new Chairperson of the Budget and Appropriations Committee will \\nconsider this and put it in the Budget line, so that the contractor can come back to the site and \\ncomplete the already started work of tarmacking the same road. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I  want  to  report  that  it  was  not  done  to  our  expectation  in  my \\nconstituency. As I speak, it is only 31 per cent of all the areas in my constituency that benefited \\nfrom the same programme. On this, I urge the Kenya Kwanza Government to still re-consider \\nbudgeting for the same, so that our constituents can benefit from the same programme. \\n \\nI  want  to  weigh  in  on  the  issue  of  the  National  Government-Constituencies \\nDevelopment Fund (NG-CDF). I am a product of the same. I benefited so many times during \\nmy schooling days. A lot of our students are at home due to lack of school fees. It is causing \\nmayhem. Parents are calling left, right and centre asking about bursaries. I urge all concerned \\nbodies that it is for the benefit of our country to have the NG-CDF back. I know it is a matter \\nthat is being handled by different entities. I believe it is godly and timely. Were it not for the \\nNG-CDF, as a Member of Parliament, I do not know where I would be. There are projects that \\nI have seen with my naked eyes being undertaken by the NG-CDF to prosperity. For instance, \\nthere  is  a  new  institution  within  my  constituency.  At  this  moment,  I  congratulate  my \\npredecessor, Mheshimiwa Gideon Kosgey, who initiated the Kenya Medical Training College \\n(KMTC) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Siongiroi Campus. It is located at Siongiroi. I promise my constituents that one of \\nmy priorities is to complete this institution. If NG-CDF is not there, I will face the wrath of \\nwananchi. They will not understand that I am no longer able to access NG-CDF as was the \\ncase initially. There are many pending projects in my constituency that I would wish to oversee \\nto completion, that is, if the constituency continues to benefit from the same kitty. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I want to speak in particular about a Technical Training Institute \\n(TTI) that is in Chebunyo Ward, within my constituency. It was a project that was initiated but \\nit  is  not  in  good  shape  as  we  speak  today.  One  of  the  reasons  is  that  it  lacks  the  necessary \\nequipment  to  make  it  functional.  As  I  report  today,  I  have  roughly  less  than  400  students \\nwhereas a similar institution that started at the same time has more than 2,000 students. I would \\nreally want to follow the matter up with this TVET. \\n\\nThank you. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Is that the mood of the House, that the Mover should proceed \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Funyula, what is your point of order? \\nHon. (Dr). Ojiambo Oundo  (Funyula, ODM):  Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you for \\n \\nthis  opportunity.  We  are  debating  a  Motion  moved  under  Standing  Order  172,  which  is  the \\nappointment  of  Members  to  the  Committee  on  Selection.  It  is  an  extremely  important \\nCommittee that will set this House into motion to work. In view of the fact that time is almost \\nlapsing,  I  stand  on  Standing  Order  95.  With  your  permission,  I  ask  that  the  Mover  be  now \\ncalled upon to reply.  \\n \\n \\nto reply? \\nHon. Members: Yes. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker:  I now call upon the Mover to reply. \\n \\n \\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. Let me thank \\nthe Member who has raised that matter. At this time, the interest of Members had dissipated a \\nlittle  bit  on  this  Motion.  I  thank  the  Members  who  have  contributed  to  this  Motion  and \\nsupported the appointment of this very important Committee on Selection. It will now get down \\nto work and place all our Members into their respective Committees.  \\nI  reply,  I  request  that  you  consider  putting  the  question  as  the  first  order  of  business  this \\nafternoon because of the obvious reason. If you look around the Chamber, you can see. With \\nthose few remarks,  I thank all Members and we  look  forward to  putting the question in  the \\nafternoon and transacting the other business lined up in the afternoon.  \\n\\nAs \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThank you, Hon.

Speaker: Member for Kakamega County, Hon. Elsie Muhanda. \\nHon. Elsie Muhanda (Kakamega County, ODM): Hon. Speaker, I beg to give notice \\n\\nThat, aware that school meals are an important safety net for vulnerable children from \\nfood insecure households and communities in Kenya; appreciating that school meals have \\nmultiple  benefits  such  as  increased  school  enrolments  and  attendance  as  well  as  a \\nsignificant and positive contribution to reducing hunger and nutritional intake; noting that  \\nprimary school completion rates have been found to be higher in schools with meals thus \\nschool  meals  remain  a  core  development  intervention  to  support  the  country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nachievements  in  the  education  sector;  recognising  that  some  county  governments  have \\nadopted direct and community-led initiatives for Early Childhood Development Education \\n(ECDE)  school  feeding  programmes;  concerned  that  the  exercise  is  not  supported  with \\nclear  policy  and  budgetary  framework  and  does  not  support  pupils  in  the  primary  and \\nsecondary  schools  or  forms  the  basic  education  ecosystem;  cognisant  of  the  fact  that \\nprovision of school meal programmes where they have been initiated encounters different \\nchallenges  impeding  their  effectiveness,  including:  insufficient  resources  due  to  low \\nbudgetary allocation and cuts, lack of school feeding policy, inadequate safe cooking and \\ndrinking  water,  drought  and  famine,  destruction  of  food  by  pests,  lengthy  and  slow \\nprocurement process, and insecurity and dilapidated infrastructure; this House resolves that \\nthe Ministry of Education, through the relevant State Department, to immediately develop \\na school feeding policy to cover basic education pupils and proposes budgetary allocation \\nto  sustain  the  programme  in  order  to  ensure  that  children  are  maintained  in  schools  for \\neffective learning.  \\nI thank you, Hon.

Speaker: The next Member is Hon. Ali Wario Guyo, Member for Garsen. \\nHon. Ali Wario (Garsen, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker.  \\nPursuant to Standing Order No.33(i), I rise to seek leave for adjournment of the House \\nin order to discuss a definite matter of national importance regarding ravaging drought in most \\nparts of the country.  Due to the late onset of long rains and depressed rainfall amount exhibited \\nby  climate  change  across  the  country,  the  drought  situation  in  the  country  has  worsened.  \\nAccording to the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA), more arid and semi-arid \\ncounties  of  Tana  River,  Turkana,  Kilifi,  Mandera,  Garissa,  Wajir,  Kwale,  Marsabit,  Kitui, \\nBaringo, Makueni, Isiolo, West Pokot, Samburu, Meru, Laikipia, Lamu, Taita Taveta, Kajiado, \\nTharaka Nithi, Embu, Nyeri and  Narok are sliding into the alarming phase of drought.  It  is \\nagainst this background that I seek leave of the House to discuss this matter of national concern. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: You need twenty Members to support your request.  \\n \\n\\n(Several Hon. Members stood in their places) \\n\\n \\nOrder Members! I am satisfied that we have the requisite number.  I will designate this \\n\\nMotion to be debated from 6.00 p.m. \\n\\nis very important. \\n\\nback to Order No.7. Member for Bumula. \\n\\nHon. Ali Wario (Garsen, ODM): Hon. Speaker, can we do that from 5.00 p.m.? This \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Okay, we can debate this Motion from 5.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. Let us go \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nPOINT OF ORDER \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWHEREABOUTS OF HON. JOHN WALUKE \\n\\nHon. Wanami Wamboka (Bumula, DAP-K): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, you may need \\n\\nto protect me from Hon. Elisha who is trying to monolise me, but it might not be possible.   \\n\\nI  rise  under  Standing  Order  No.83  to  discuss  the  whereabouts  of  a  Member  of  this \\nHouse, the Member of Parliament for Sirisia, Hon. John Koyi Waluke.  Hon. Waluke, who was \\narrested some years ago, was taken to court and charged. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Wamboka, before you proceed, remember that Hon. Waluke is   a \\nMember of this House.  You must navigate what you want to say very carefully because you \\ncannot discuss the conduct of a person, a Member of the House, without a substantive Motion.   \\nYou may go on. \\n\\nHon.  Wanami  Wamboka  (Bumula,  DAP-K):  Hon.  Speaker,  as  Members  of  this \\nHouse,  we  must  be  concerned  when  one  of  us  has  issues  around  them.  I  want  to  indulge \\nMembers  to  support  me  because  today,  we  are  discussing  Hon.  Waluke  and  tomorrow,  we \\nmight  talk  about  another  Member  of  this  House.    There  is  a  very  dangerous  trend  that  is \\nhappening in this country.  I do not understand why Hon. Waluke has been jailed for 70 years \\nor pay  a fine of Kshs1 billion whereas there are  other people in  this country  who have had \\nissues.  As I speak, if you are aligned to a certain side in this country and you have a case in \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Mr. Chumo, the Managing Director of the Kenya Power \\nCompany, had his case withdrawn. The cases of Hon. Aisha Jumwa, Hon. former Governor of \\nSamburu,  Hon.  Waititu,  Zacharia  Mbugua  and  Joyce  Ngina  among  others  have  been \\nwithdrawn!   I  do not  understand why Hon. Waluke is  still facing persecution.  I also  do not \\nunderstand why Hon. Kimunya\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case has resurfaced from nowhere.  I want to put a case\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Order Hon. Wamboka! Firstly, Hon. Waluke has been convicted by a \\ncompetent  court  of  law.  Secondly,  his  appeal  is  still  a  matter  which  is  within  the  realm  of \\npossible appeal by himself to the next court. Thirdly, court cases are dealt with and decided on \\neach individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case merit. Therefore, you cannot say that because somebody else was let go, \\neverybody  else  should,  or  vice  versa.    Therefore,  as  I  told  you,  you  are  engaged  in  a  very \\ndangerous swim in very dangerous waters. I want to encourage you that if you want to raise \\nempathy with Hon. Waluke, you are free to do so. If you want to question the competence of \\nthe courts that dealt with the case, you have no capacity do so here. \\n\\nHon. Wanami Wamboka (Bumula, DAP-K):  I am well guided, Hon Speaker. On behalf \\nof Sirisia people of Bungoma County and Kenyans at large\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I empathise with those people \\nwho, perhaps, feel targeted and side-lined. I want to be in the shoes of Hon. John Koyi Waluke. \\nI want him to know that he is not alone. I want him to know that he is not a child of a lesser \\nGod. I want him to know that we stand with him and this too, shall pass.   \\n\\nHon. Speaker, thank you so much. \\nHon. Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Thank you Hon. Speaker. I was struggling \\nto listen to the gist of what the Member for Bumula was asking the House and you properly \\nguided him. But, Hon. Speaker, even after you guided him, he has not withdrawn the tirade he \\nhad against the Judiciary let alone any of the other sentiments he had expressed that bordered \\non sub judice.  Hon. Speaker, as  you have properly guided him, it would only have been in \\norder, since we are a House of records, that the Member for Bumula withdraws the short tirade \\nhe made by mentioning people who are not in this House like Hon. Kimunya and others. They \\nshould be allowed to handle their matters before the Judiciary. He just changed tangent and \\npretended to be with the people of Sirisia. The Member for Bumula has not even stood in his \\nplace to thank the people of Bumula for electing him! He now pretends to be speaking on behalf \\nof the people of Sirisia, who also have elected a Member of Parliament and it is only fair that \\nthe Member for Bumula rises in his place and withdraws everything from the record that is \\ntouching on cases that are before competent courts of law and that are being adjudicated. \\n\\nAs you said from the beginning, we should not use this chamber\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 You know we enjoy \\ncertain  privileges  as  Members  of  Parliament,  but  we  are  never  to  be  seen  to  be  using  this \\nchamber to disparage other institutions, or even persons who cannot defend themselves here. \\nThe  Member  for  Bumula  was  completely  out  of  order  and  he  ought  to  have  withdrawn  the \\nearlier tirade before he changed tangent to now pretend to be speaking for the people of Bumula \\nand Sirisia combined.  Sirisia is an independent constituency from Bumula as much as they are \\nfound in the same county. The Member for Bumula cannot pretend to speak for the people of \\nSirisia. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Speaker: This statement will not elicit any debate and I want to advise Members \\nthat if you really care for Hon.

Hon. Omboko Milemba, MP \\n4.  Hon. Farah Maalim, MP \\n5.  Hon. Peter Kaluma, MP \\n6.  Hon. (Dr.) Rachel Nyamai, MP  \\n\\n        \\n    \\n\\n-   Third Chairperson of Committees \\n-    Fourth Chairperson of Committees \\n-    Fifth Chairperson of Committees \\n-    Sixth Chairperson of Committees \\n\\nHon. Speaker, as Members are aware, having elected our Speaker and Deputy Speaker, \\nwe are required under our Standing Order 16 to elect another person to preside over the House \\npursuant to Article 107(1)(c), which deals with presiding in Parliament and provides that the \\nSpeaker shall preside over all sittings of the House and in his absence, the Deputy Speaker, and \\nif they are both not there, a Member of the House elected by the House presides.   \\n\\nTherefore,  what  we  are  doing  in  approval  of  this  Panel  is  basically  equivalent  to  an \\nelection of the persons who will be presiding over the House in the absence of the Speaker or \\nthe Deputy Speaker. Previously, the Speaker would simply pick any Member in the chamber \\nto preside on his behalf, but subsequently under Standing Order 16, we created that proviso \\nthat we can institutionalise the Panel of Chairpersons to help the speakership in ensuring that \\nthere is seamless presiding of the House in the absence of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker. \\nAgain, in line with the same Standing Order 16, those who served with us in the 11th and \\n12th Parliaments, remember, we had four Chairpersons, but now under the 6th Edition of the \\nStanding  Orders,  we  have  six  Members  in  the  13th  Parliament  to  preside  the  House  in  the \\nabsence of both the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker. \\n\\nTherefore, by merely approving this list of Chairpersons, it will be deemed under Article \\n107(1)(c) of the Constitution and our own Standing Orders that we have in effect elected the \\nsix  persons  that  are  listed  on  the  Order  Paper  that  I  have  read  out.  All  these  are  ranking \\nMembers.  Hon.  Peter  Kaluma,  Hon.  David  Ochieng,  Hon.  Martha  Wangare  and  Hon.  (Dr.) \\nRachael Nyamai are all serving their third terms in Parliament. Hon. Omboko Milemba who is \\nright  behind  me,  is  also  doing  his  second  term  and  has  been  a  diligent  Member  in  the  last \\nParliament when he first joined the House. It is also important to note that Hon. Farah Maalim, \\nbesides being a candidate for Deputy Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position, he is also serving his third term. He \\nalso  served  this  House  as  Deputy  Speaker  to  Hon.  Marende,  the  then  Speaker,  in  the  10th \\nParliament.  \\n\\nI will, therefore, ask Members to support the proposed Members for approval by the \\nHouse as Members of the Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Panel. For the benefit of our new Members\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I know Hon. \\nFarah Maalim had not seen where I was seated as I paid accolades to him being a seasoned \\nveteran  of  the  House.  For  the  benefit  of  our  new  Members  of  Parliament,  the  Panel  of \\nChairpersons consists of Members who basically preside over the Third Reading. During the \\ninduction, I am sure we all went through the stages of legislation. The most important stage of \\nlegislation is not the Second Reading where we debate in plenary, but rather the Third Reading. \\nThese Chairpersons are the ones who preside over the House during the Third Reading.  \\n\\nI really want to encourage our first-time Members of the 13th Parliament to, please, take \\ntheir time when we begin real business. I know Members have been very eager to make their \\nmaiden  speeches  in  this  season  when  there  is  no  much  business  to  transact  other  than  the \\nProcedural Motions and a few other Motions that we have done. However, when we come to \\nactual  legislative  work  in  the  enactment  of  Bills,  besides  what  happens  in  committees,  the \\nactual legislation is done in the Third Reading. Please, take your time. Be present during the \\nThird Reading. There have been tendencies, especially in the 11th and 12th Parliaments where I \\nam fortunate to have served, of Members massively walking out immediately the Chairperson \\ntook to the Chair for the Third Reading. I beg we take time.  \\n\\nWithout  mentioning names,  I remember an incident  in  the 11th Parliament where we \\nchanged legislation during the Third Reading to create a provision that had just been declared \\nunconstitutional  by  the  courts  to  require  people  who  qualified  to  be  elected  as  Members  of \\nParliament to be university graduates. Half of the people who were not university graduates \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Others  were  enjoying  their  cup  of  tea  at  the Members  lounge. \\nAfter we finished, one Member, whom I do not want to mention because he is not in this House \\ntoday, came running back asking \\xe2\\x80\\x9cImepitia wapi?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I do not want to say there would be any \\nmischief in the kind of Bills that we will pass, but I pray that nobody will come running back \\nto the chamber asking \\xe2\\x80\\x9cilipitia wapi\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ama \\xe2\\x80\\x9cilipitishwa Bunge gani\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and yet  you are seated \\nhere. Please, be active during the Third Reading and support these Chairpersons. They are all \\nseasoned  parliamentarians.  They  have  our  unequivocal  support.  We  will  support  all  the  six \\nChairpersons.  \\n\\nLastly, as much as Hon. Farah Maalim ran for the Deputy Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position against \\nthe  substantive  Deputy  Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\xa6    Hon.  Omboko  Milemba  is  from  the  Amani  National \\nCongress (ANC), Farah Maalim is from the Wiper Democratic Movement-Kenya, Hon. Peter \\nKaluma is from the ODM, Hon.  Nyamai is from the Jubilee Party and Hon. David Ochieng is \\na party leader of his own party in the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. \\n\\n In as much as the Speaker has balanced the political representation across the Floor, \\nthese Chairpersons do not come to serve the House as Members who represent their political \\nparties, or are affiliated to any coalition. When they sit to preside over the House, they do so \\non behalf of the Speaker who is not aligned to any political coalition. I would really beg all the \\nsix Chairpersons that when they take charge, they should, please, be impartial, objective and \\nallow all Members a fair opportunity to articulate their issues.  \\n\\nWith those many remarks, I have the honour to move this Motion, and request Hon. \\n\\nOpiyo Wandayi, to second.  \\n\\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja, ODM): Hon. Speaker, allow me to second the Motion \\nfor the adoption of the approval of the proposed Members of the Chairpersons Panel. I wish to \\necho what Hon. Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah has said. I have no doubt, whatsoever, in my mind, that these six \\nhonourable Members qualify to serve in those capacities. I must also appreciate the fact that \\nthis is as a result of a very intensive consultation which I am told has happened for the first \\ntime since the advent of the new Constitution, that both sides of the House, at least, had a say \\nor an opinion on who eventually ended up being proposed to sit in that exalted Panel.  \\n\\nHon. Speaker, as you can see from the representation, these are Members who represent \\ndiverse backgrounds and interests for that matter. I hope that immediately they assume office \\nas we wish they do, they will quickly move to engender confidence from amongst Members in \\nthemselves.  This  is  because  these  are  Members  who  will  not  only  preside  over  the  Third \\nReading or the Committee Stage of business of the House, but will also preside over the general \\nbusiness of the House as Speakers, in the absence of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker.  \\n\\nIn the morning,  I raised an issue while  your Deputy was on the seat.  I hope that the \\nMembers now coming on board as Members of the Chairperson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Panel will take note of what \\nI had mentioned in the morning that Members want to see fairness by  whoever is presiding \\nover the business of the House at any given time. Members have complained a lot that many \\ntimes they feel they are left out while they are queuing to make contributions. These are issues \\nI  am  sure  will  be  dealt  with  so  that  Members  have  confidence  that  whoever  is  presiding \\nexercises fairness, equity, and generally, sound judgement, so that they get an opportunity to \\ncommunicate not only to the country, but also to their constituents.  Otherwise, I have no doubt \\nthat these are Hon. Members who will deliver on their new mandate.  \\n\\nThank you, I second. \\nHon. Speaker: Order, Hon. Members.  \\n \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\n \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Members, there being no interest in debating this Motion, I now \\n\\n \\nput the Question. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Members,  the  Committee  on  Appointments  at  Order  8  that  was  debated  in  the \\nmorning and approved a few minutes ago will meet tomorrow, Thursday, 13th October 2022 at \\n11.00  a.m.  at  County  Hall,  Mini  Chamber  to  get  a  briefing  on  their  work  and  consider  the \\nvetting schedule. It is for them to start vetting the Cabinet nominees on Monday. The Members \\nthat  you  have  just  approved,  the  Chairperson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Panel,  will  meet  tomorrow  Thursday  13th \\nOctober, 2022 at 10.00 a.m. in the Speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Boardroom.  \\n\\nThank you. Next Order. \\nLet us have the Leader for Majority. \\n \\n\\nMOTION \\n\\n \\n\\nAPPROVAL OF THE CALENDAR OF THE HOUSE \\n\\n \\n \\nthe following Motion:   \\n\\nHon. Kimani Ichung'wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker I beg to move \\n\\nThat, pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order 28, this House approves the \\nCalendar of the National Assembly (Regular Sessions) for the First Session (2022) as \\ncontained in the Schedule to the Order Paper. \\n \\nHon. Speaker, Members will see that the last page of the Order Paper is a Schedule that \\nhas  our  House  Calendar  and  the  House  Business  Committee  (HBC)  that  we  approved \\nyesterday. We had a meeting immediately after approval by the House. It has proposed that we \\nhave a total of 33 sittings or 10 weeks, excluding any Special or Joint Sittings and any other \\nadditional Sittings as may be approved by the House in this First Session that runs from the \\ntime we came in on 29th September 2022 to 1st December 2022.  \\n \\nHon. Speaker, Members are aware that the First Session is guided by various businesses \\nand  activities,  including  some  of  what  we  have  already  done.  For  example,  the  induction \\nworkshop that we did with Members at Safari Park Hotel early last month and formation of the \\nHouse committees which we have just done. This will enable commencement of the approval \\nof cabinet secretaries and other State officers as may be relayed to us by the President. With \\nthe approval of the Appointments Committee, that will commence.  \\n \\nHon. Speaker, there is  the appointment of the Parliamentary Service Commissioners \\nwhose terms may have expired as well as the election of the bicameral Members to the East \\nAfrican  Legislative  Assembly  (EALA),  or  any  other  urgent  Government  business  that  may \\nrequire consideration by the House. That is what will largely guide our business in this First \\nSession that runs until 1st December 2022. It is also worth noting that in the Calendar that we \\nhave laid out\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Members will note that the school calendar for third term runs until around 25th \\nNovember, then students break for school holidays until 22nd January 2023. Looking around, \\nyou  will  realise  that  this  13th  Assembly  has  quite  a  number  of  young  parents  with  young \\nchildren who will be breaking for their school holidays. These Members had a very rough time \\nduring the election campaigns. They need that short break in December to spend time with their \\nchildren and bond during the school holidays. \\n \\nI would like to encourage Members\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n \\n\\n(Several Hon. Members spoke off record) \\n\\nHon. Speaker, I am being reminded by the Member for Gatanga Constituency, Wakili \\n\\nMuriu, that it is not bonding with their children, but also their wives. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Speaker, let me not get into what I am being persuaded to. I encourage those of \\nus that are young parents to spent time with their life partners, children and their other bigger \\nchildren; their constituents. This is the time when we take a break in December. It is the first \\nlong  break  that  you  will  have.  Go  back  to  your  constituency  and  organise  affairs  at  the \\nconstituency level. This Calendar has taken all that into consideration. The truth is that right \\nafter the campaigns, you have a very busy session these two months until 1st December. We \\nintend to take a short break of about 10 days from tomorrow 14th October 2022 to 24th October, \\n2022.  We  will  take  a  short  recess.  As  I  indicated,  it  is  a  short,  but  busy  working  recess, \\nespecially for those Members who have been appointed to the Committee on Appointments \\nand  the  Committee  on  Selections.  It  is  during  this  recess  that  we  intend  to  vet  the  cabinet \\nsecretaries and other State officers who have been nominated by the President.  \\n \\nThe Committee on Selections will place our Members in  the various committees, so \\nthat by the time we resume on 25th October, in the afternoon, we expect that hopefully, the two \\ncommittees will have completed their work and will table their reports on the vetting of the \\ncabinet secretaries as well as placing the report from the Committee on Selections on placement \\nof Members to the various committees.  \\n\\nHon. Speaker, this Calendar also  takes us to  the next  Session because we resume as \\nguided by the Standing Orders, probably, I think on the second Tuesday of February 2023. So, \\nwhen you take a break in January, your children will be going back to school then. You will be \\nleft with  your wives at home and our constituents. We must then spend more time with our \\nspouses and constituents. The House Business Committee has considered all these things in \\nagreeing on the dates. So, all of us have another one month for further bonding.  \\n \\n I encourage Members to make use of that time because when we resume again next \\nyear, we will be very busy. The budget cycle will have started. Those who will be lucky to be \\nnominated  to  the  Budget  and  Appropriations  Committee,  the  Finance  Committee  and  other \\ndepartmental committees, you will be very busy from the end of January, early February all \\nthe way to June. I am saying this to encourage, especially the new Members, to know that if \\nyou do not spend time in your constituency during this long recess, you may lose touch with \\nthe ground. \\n \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\nHon.

Kimani Ichung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Hon.

Members will note that this \\nparticular Procedural Motion is giving the Mover a whole hour because this is on reports by \\neither the Public Accounts Committee, the Public Investments Committee, the Special Funds \\nCommittee or other audit committees.

Speaker: Hon. Members, as I propose this Motion, I direct the Member for Bura \\nthat we will bring forward his time for moving a Motion of Adjournment after this Motion. We \\nwill start with his Motion immediately hereafter.  \\n\\n \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\nHon. Speaker: There being no interest in debating the Motion, I will put the question.  \\n\\n(Question put and agreed to) \\n\\n \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Members, we will now go back to Order No. 6. This relates to the \\nMotion of Adjournment to which authority has been granted to the Member for Bura. It is the \\nMember for Garsen but not Bura. I am sorry, Mheshimiwa, but you are neighbours. I call upon \\nthe Hon. Member to move the Motion. \\n \\nHon. Members, it means that this Motion will run from now, 4.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. \\nYou have three hours. Under Standing Order 33, contribution to such a Motion is limited to \\nfive  minutes  for  every  Member.  When  you  are  called  upon  to  contribute,  compose  your \\nmessages, focus your contribution and deal with the issue. Drought is ravaging many parts of \\nour country, particularly the Northern parts of Kenya, the Eastern parts of Kenya and the Coast.  \\n \\n \\n\\nWelcome Member for Garsen to move your Motion. \\n\\nMOTION OF ADJOURNMENT ON A MATTER \\n\\nOF URGENT NATIONAL IMPORTANCE \\n\\nRAVAGING DROUGHT IN THE COUNTRY \\n\\n  \\nHon.  Ali  Wario  (Garsen,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker  for  giving  me  this \\n \\nopportunity. The cumulative impact of four consecutive poor rainy seasons has caused ravaging \\ndrought and hunger to rapidly rise in the country.  \\nHon. Speaker: Member, you have 10 minutes for moving the Motion. \\n \\nHon.  Ali  Wario  (Garsen,  ODM):  Thank  you.  The  cumulative  impact  of  four \\n \\nconsecutive poor rainy seasons has caused ravaging drought and hunger to rapidly rise in the \\ncountry, especially in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs). This has resulted in estimated 3.5 \\nmillion  people  experiencing  acute  food  insecurity  and  in  urgent  need  of  humanitarian \\nassistance. A fifth consecutive poor rainy season will be disastrous. \\n \\nThe household food security continues to deteriorate, with 942 children aged between \\nsix  and  95  months,  pregnant  and  lactating  mothers  acutely  malnourished  and  in  need  of \\ntreatment.  Livestock  deaths  driven  by  drought  have  been  reported  in  most  parts  of  ASAL \\ncounties. The general increase in the prices of most consumer goods continues to weaken the \\npurchasing power of most consumer goods. This has worsened the food security situation. \\nThere is a call to action in response to climate change to mitigate its effect. There is \\n \\nneed to invest in policies that reassure our commitment to climate action. As you are aware, \\nthe  drought  has  really  affected  our  areas,  especially  in  Garsen  Constituency  in  Tana  River \\nCounty. We are doing water trucking, which is very expensive because the source of water is \\n160 kilometres away. In an area like Othoganda Location, the lions and hyenas nearly feed on \\nour mothers because they fight due to the scarcity of water. The drought also affects the school-\\ngoing children. Assa Boarding School faces closure because there is no water and food. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The wildlife has moved to the scarce source of \\n \\nwater,  which  is  a  well  that  is  being  dug  by  hand.  We  need  urgent  intervention.  Deaths  of \\nlivestock  and  people  have  been  reported  because  of  hunger  and  thirst.  I  am  requesting  this \\nHouse to approve the urgent intervention by the Government for this situation to be handled. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, there are policies by the Government to construct mega dams in those \\n\\naffected areas. Once this is done, we will have a long-lasting solution for those areas. \\n\\nI  beg  to  move  the  Motion.  I  want  my  good  brother,  former  Cabinet  Secretary,  Hon. \\nMwangi Kiunjuri, to second. Thank you, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Kiunjuri, I will exercise discretion and give you your five minutes \\n\\n \\nand the balance of his five minutes for you to talk for 10 minutes.  \\nHon. Mwangi Kiunjuri (Laikipia East, TSP): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. This is a very \\n \\nimportant Motion. Before I make my contribution, I really want to thank the people of Laikipia \\nEast for electing me for the fourth time. They elected me for 15 consecutive years, which are \\nthree terms, and now they have also given me another opportunity. \\nI congratulate you on being elected to the seat of the Speaker and your Deputy. I know \\n \\nthat this House is in safe hands. It is important to note that we have a record of being in this \\nHouse since the 1990s. We have enough experience. I also had the opportunity to serve as a \\nCS in the previous Government, and was in charge of the Department of Special Programmes \\nunder my Ministry. Therefore, this is an area that I am knowledgeable in. It is one of the areas \\nthat  need  to  be  taken  seriously  by  this  House.  I  hope  that  it  will  not  end  by  discussing  this \\nMotion today. \\n \\nDrought  does  not  only  affect  this  country;  it  is  a  worldwide  phenomenon.  Climate \\nchange is real. It has really affected the lives of many people in the world. High cost of living \\nis being experienced everywhere not only because of the crude oil prices, but also the cost of \\nessential commodities. Very few people can feed their families. The cost of food is also very \\nhigh. People have no money and many youths are jobless.  \\n\\nTherefore, as we debate today, it is important to note that climate change is real. If you \\nobserve the drought cycle in this country, and you look at what was happening in the 1970s \\nand 1980s, it used to occur between eight and 10 years. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the cycle \\nchanged from eight to 10 years, and it was between four and five  years. What is happening \\ntoday is that the cycle has now come down to two to three years, which is really worrying. \\n \\nHon. Speaker, there are a number of interventions that have been put in place. However, \\nwe do not have any particular policy that has been highlighted that can be carried in unison to \\nensure that we can, at least, predict on what to do this year or next year. There are measures \\nwhich have been taken. For example, we have policy documents that are in place, like Ending \\nDrought Emergency Strategy. That strategy was made and it is already in place to ensure that \\nkey development activities are undertaken, both long term and short term. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, we have the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) policy programme in \\nplace.  It  is  being  revised today. We also  have National  Disaster Risk  Management  Bill  and \\nPolicy already at the Cabinet level. We do not know when it will land in this House. We have \\na  Resilience  Programme  Framework  not  yet  finalised  and  signed.  It  clearly  indicates  key \\nactivities that are supposed to be implemented to build resilience. There are key priority areas \\nthat  must  be  considered.  For  example,  peace  and  security  is  threatened  whenever  there  is \\ndrought. We have cattle rustlers raiding each other and causing many deaths. There is a lot of \\ninsecurity in this country today. Insecurity is not only in terms of human to human but also, \\nhuman-wildlife conflicts in areas that border forests and ranches. We are being threatened. The \\nlittle that would have been harvested during harvest period is harvested by wild animals. There \\nis elephant menace all over the country. We need to prioritise how we tackle drought to ensure \\nthat we have security in this country.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Those  young  people, \\nespecially the ones  coming from ASAL  counties, do not  have the opportunity to  get  proper \\neducation. Therefore, affirmative action, must be put in place. For example, for schools, we \\nneed low cost boarding primary schools to ensure that kids are kept in school. The institutions \\nthat are there must be strengthened. We need to create policies to deal with the drought situation \\nin the country  \\n\\nHon.  Speaker,  women  empowerment  is  also  very  important.  Other  issues  include \\ninstitutional strengthening. On institutional strengthening, there must be clarification of roles \\nand responsibilities that are carried out between the national and the county governments. We \\nneed  to  have  a  clear  line  on  when  the  national  Government  should  intervene  and  when  the \\ncounty government can intervene. This must be very clear because if you leave a responsibility \\nthat is supposed to be taken seriously to the county governments, most of them cannot rise to \\nthe occasion.  \\n\\nThere is the issue of enhanced governance and accountability. Right now, distribution \\nof  relief  food  is  ongoing  in  those  counties  that  have  been  privileged.  For  most  of  us,  our \\ncounties have not been able to receive relief food. How do we account, not only for the funds, \\nbut also the distribution of relief food? Through monitoring and evaluation of relief distribution \\nin  the  government  departments  involved.  This  is  one  of  the  departments  that  must  be \\nstrengthened in this country. Why would we wait year-in, year-out for the Auditor-General to \\ncome and pinpoint the ills in the Ministries on what happened five to ten years ago? At the end \\nof the day, the report from the Auditor General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office will land in this House three to five \\nyears after the ills have happened. It is therefore, important to make sure that the departments \\nof monitoring and evaluation are strengthened to cure any ill in time.  \\n\\nThere are policies that need to be harmonised and finalised. We have so many policies \\nthat are running. If we harmonize them to know when each one comes into place, then we will \\nsay this country is moving in the right direction. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, some of the programmes have been put  in  place through the Drought \\nEmergency Strategy. Some areas had been prioritised to build the dams where water harvesting \\ncould  be  done  and  the  measures  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  farming  communities  and  the \\npastoralist communities are living in harmony and in support of each other. These strategies \\nare in place.  Instead of us looking at what is most important, we have put our priorities upside \\ndown. We have the Big Four Agenda. If we address the question of agriculture, we can support \\nother activities. When a country is well fed, health is not curative but preventive. I am happy \\nthat  the  President  addressed  himself  to  this  issue.    He  promised  to  support  agriculture. \\nAgriculture is not only about crops; it encompasses fishing and livestock. \\n\\nLastly, Hon. Speaker, the issue of emergency food is so important. There are people \\nwho are almost dying. In schools, our pupils are fainting in classrooms and enrolment has gone \\ndown. We, therefore, are calling upon the Government to distribute food immediately to our \\nschools to support our pupils to go through the education system. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. I beg to support. \\nHon. Speaker: To second. \\nHon. Mwangi Kiunjuri (Laikipia East, TSP): I beg to second. \\nHon. Speaker:  Hon. Members,  I now propose the Question that this House do now \\n\\nadjourn. \\n \\n\\n \\nWe have plenty of time. Each Member will speak. If you hold your horses, there should \\nbe no unnecessary canvassing. Each one of you will have time.

A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c12th October 2022                       NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                               17 \\n\\nHon. Farah Yakub (Fafi, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. Indeed, I am humbled that \\nyou have given me this chance. At very least, I thought my card was not working. I have been \\nhere  for  the  last  five  days,  from  the  start  of  a  Sitting  to  the  end,  believing  that  there  was \\nsomething wrong with my card numbers. Our senior brothers who have been here before have \\nnot shown us the tricks to move up in the queuing system. Having said that, I would have been \\nthe first person to congratulate you, but I will give you a fermented congratulation, as they say \\nin our family. Congratulations for being elected.   I want to thank and bow to my people, the \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Fafians\\xe2\\x80\\x99. A special bow to the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hangolites\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for delivering this seat and giving me the mandate \\nto represent them; the power to legislate and the mantle to oversight in this House.  \\n\\nThank you very much. \\nHon. Speaker, it is also an honour that the subject matter, when I am given a chance to \\ntalk, is dear and very important to me and my people. Fafi Constituency in Garissa Town is the \\nlargest constituency in Garissa. It has a 45 kilometre stretch of River Tana and 50-kilometre \\nborderline to  Somalia.  It  is  a constituency with  people of great  generosity. They harboured, \\nwelcomed and hosted over 200,000 Somali refugees.  \\n\\nHon.  Speaker,  as  we  speak  about  drought,  every  household  in  Fafi  ward,  the  host \\ncommunity in that area, hosts about five to ten individuals who are famine-influx refugees from \\nthe southern part of Somalia, Gedo region. They are about 65,000 people. They have not been \\nregistered and they have not been catered for. They are a burden to our families whose main \\nproblem today is bringing bread to the table. \\n\\nHon.  Speaker,  drought  has  been  an  issue  in  this constituency  since  Independence;  it \\ncomes and goes.  It has now hit us hard as it is the fifth season without rain in that area.  The \\nfunny part is that if you live two kilometres from the river in that constituency, you have no \\nwater.  The farthest point from the river to the border line in my constituency is 200 kilometres.  \\nIf funds are given, I believe that water could be pumped from River Tana to the farthest point \\nin my constituency and today I would not be here saying that there is lack of water in my area. \\n \\nThe government has made a lot of interventions but of little importance. This shows the \\nimportance of little things. Rain harvesting was the main intervention by the Government.  As \\nwe speak, there are over 200 water pans dug in that constituency.  I can see that the red light is \\non.  Drought  in  our  area  has  culminated  to  lack  of  water.    This  has  led  to  the  closure  of  28 \\nprimary schools and others are almost being closed. The lack of water causes insecurity in the \\narea because of conflict in the few water pans that have water.  This is an area that hosts the \\nArawale Reserve. However, because of lack of water and drought the Hilora, which is a rare \\nwildlife species is less than 100 today as opposed to 10,000 in the 1980s.  \\n \\nHon. Speaker, I second and support the Motion on Adjournment. This is a dear subject \\nin  our  area  and  I  want  great  government  intervention  in  the  area.    The  Government  should \\nenhance sector \\xe2\\x80\\xa6. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Member for Laikipia West. \\nHon. Wachira Karani (Laikipia West, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving \\n\\nme this opportunity to contribute to this Motion.  \\n\\nFirst, I join the other Members in congratulating you for being elected the Speaker of \\nthe National Assembly.  Second, I would like to thank the people of Laikipia West for seeing \\nit fit to vote for me as their Member of Parliament.  This is not the first time they have voted \\nfor me.  In 2013 the good people of Laikipia West elected me as their Member of Parliament. \\nIn 2017, they gave me a five-year break and I had time to reflect.  They then voted me back in \\nthe last general election. I thank them and assure them that I will perform my duties as they \\nexpect of me.  I am now more energised and I will deliver the promises that I made to them \\nduring the campaigns.  \\n\\n[The Speaker (Hon.

Gladys Boss) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  on  the  Motion  at  hand,  we  are  also  experiencing  the  same \\nproblem  in  Laikipia County though it is  not  as severe as it is  in  northern Kenya.  We have \\nplenty of crops but we also have problems. Like my counterpart the Member for Laikipia East, \\nHon. Mwangi Kiunjuri has said, we have conflict between the wildlife and the people. I want \\nthis Government to address that situation because if the little crops we have are conserved, they \\ncan be of help in other areas facing drought. \\n\\nThe  other  thing  I  would  like  to  address  is  that  there  is  a  difficult  cycle  in  our  area.  \\nWhenever  we  start  planting,  the  prices  of  seeds  and  fertilisers  go  up.    However,  when  it  is \\nharvesting season \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like now we plan to start harvesting starting from this month to next month \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 the prices of farm produce go down.  We ask the Government to intervene.  There was the \\npromise that the prices of farm produce will be looked at.  I pray that we will fulfil that. \\n\\nThank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you very much, Member for Laikipia West.  I know that \\nyou had great difficulty with your missing card yesterday. I hope that you have recovered it \\nnow. \\n\\nNext, we have the Member for Samburu North. \\nHon.  Letipila  Eli  (Samburu  North,  UDA):  Thank  you  very  much,  Hon.  Deputy \\n\\nSpeaker. \\n \\nFirst of all, I would like to thank the great people of Samburu North for giving me the \\nopportunity to represent them in this august house. I would also like to thank them for electing \\nleaders who stood on a platform of peace in the just concluded elections.  I encourage them \\nthat the path of peace will only come through dialogue.  I also assure them that I will walk on \\nthat path.  I thank them for their support, prayers, encouragement and the believe that peace is \\npossible in Samburu North. \\n \\nThe  people  of  northern  Kenya  are  languishing  in  acute  famine  which  has  not  been \\nwitnessed in generations.  It is a matter of life and death.  To be specific, as of last week, in \\nSamburu County, there were almost 40,000 households in dire need of food interventions.  We \\nall know that famine is cyclic in the northern Kenya. We also know that next year and the year \\nafter that, there will be famine in  that area.   It  is  a shame that we stand on the floor of this \\nHouse and talk about acute famine yet there have been papers and strategic plans but very little \\nimplementation on the ground. \\n \\nI  would  like  to  laud  the  President  for  the  speech  he  delivered  in  this  House.    I  also \\nappreciate the food that he has given as a relief measure to northern Kenya counties.  I thank \\nhim on behalf of the people of Samburu North but I would like to tell him that the food was \\ninadequate. In his speech, he alluded to value addition on livestock products. I would like to \\nask that the livestock off-take programmes be quickly implemented.  This is  because it is  a \\ngreat  loss  to  lose  livestock  in  this  famine.  The  Government  can  \\xe2\\x80\\x98off-take\\xe2\\x80\\x99  livestock  and \\nsupplement families. \\n \\nI would also like to speak about the perennial underdevelopment in northern Kenya.  \\nThe President talked about livestock off-take programmes and industrialisation  in the north.  \\nWe would like him to address the Sessional Papers which legitimised the underdevelopment \\nof some parts in this country, not just in words, but also in action. \\n \\nI also want to put it on the Floor of this House that there have been cases of children \\nfainting in classrooms.  There was a fatality case in Samburu East five days ago.  I would like \\nthe Government to step in and resume the school feeding programme which has not been in \\nplace since June this year. Those are among the issues that I would like to contribute to the \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I will try to be brief. \\n\\n First and foremost, let me take this exceptional opportunity to thank my family, and \\nthe   great people of Taveta for the exceptional privileged they have bestowed on me to serve \\nthem as their Member of Parliament. \\n\\n  I have followed the proceedings of this House keenly, for the last five days. I have \\nprayed very much to get an opportunity to speak. I am pleased to note that it is a huge privilege. \\nAnd as Senator McCain said, it is a service to a course better than my interests.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, my standing here means that the Chamber has said goodbye to \\none of its finest Woman parliamentarian and my predecessor, Dr. Naomi Shaban.  Dr. Naomi \\nhas enjoyed a distinguished, political career for 20 years; and has mentored many women in \\nKenya, and I respect her for that. I pray that I will fit in her shoes and more importantly, I pray \\nthat God will open new doors for her. \\n\\nMy being here is God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will.  I want to take this rare opportunity to thank God for giving \\n\\nme this opportunity to serve in this august House. \\n\\n With respect to Taveta Constituency, I have taken leadership at a time when there are \\nmany  challenges.  Many  of  my  constituents  are  watching  me  right  now;  and  one  of  their \\nconcerns is the issue of infrastructure, especially, the Taveta- Llasit Road. This road is worse \\nthan the one to hell.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I want to address two issues: one, I appreciate the intervention \\nthat has been made by the Government of Kenya to distribute food to three million Kenyans. \\nHowever,  I  dare  say  that  it  is  not  enough.  The  key  concern  is  our  children  in  school.  The \\nPresident  said  that  we  will  save  Kshs300  billion.  I,  therefore,  plead  with  him  that  the  said \\namount of money that we are saving from the Ministries that he has indicated should be used \\nto ensure we have free secondary education, and food for our children in school. \\n\\nSecondly, I wish to indicate to the House that a greater population that suffers from the \\ndrought are pastoralists. Food is not enough because they too, have livestock to take care of. \\nThis House in the Year, 2013 passed the Kenyan Wildlife Conservation and Management Act, \\nNo.  47  of  2013.  Specific  interest  is  in  Section  102  of  that  Act  which  says  that  the  Cabinet \\nSecretary and the Kenya Wildlife Services should create guidelines to ensure that our grazers \\naccess National Parks for purposes of grazing and watering of livestock in times of drought \\nand national disaster. My plea today, is the implementation of Section 102... \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: I can give you an extra minute to finish your sentence. \\nHon. John Mbwire (Taveta, WDM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.  \\nI  was  saying  that  even  if  you  were  to  go  to  the  National  Parks  today,  you  will  find \\nanimals grazing there. The only problem is that they are grazing at a fee which is illegal. We \\nall  agree  that  drought  in  now  a  national  disaster.  However,  we  should  allow  our  grazers  to \\naccess the National Parks in accordance to Section 102 of the Wildlife Conservation and the \\nManagement Act.  \\n\\nWith these remarks, I thank you. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. I had to give you give you extra time. My hats off \\n\\nto you if you felt our matriarch of women politics in Kenya.   \\n\\nI now call upon the Member for Ganze. \\nHon. Kenneth Tungule (Ganze, PAA):  Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.  \\nI want to take this opportunity to thank the people from the Four Wards of Ganze \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nBamba, Jaribuni, Sokoke and Ganze \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for overwhelmingly electing me to represent them in \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I take this opportunity to also congratulate you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for \\nbeing elected to lead this House; and also the Speaker, Hon. Moses Masika Wetangula.  \\n\\nI  come  from  Ganze  which  is  a  very  dry  Constituency.  It  still  faces  a  myriad  of \\nchallenges many years after Independence. They are still struggling with the necessities of life \\nsuch as poor housing, water shortage, poor infrastructure and lack of good education.  \\n\\nAlmost 80 per cent of Ganze is currently affected by the ravages of the ongoing drought \\nand famine.  Livestock farming, which is the economic mainstay has severely been hampered \\nas all pastures have dried up.  The few water ponds which are shared by human and wildlife \\nhave been invaded by the elephants from the Tsavo East National Park. \\n\\nParagraph 44 of the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Speech says that 3.5 million Kenyans are affected by \\ndrought and famine in Kenya. This is the true position in Ganze right now. As we speak, it has \\nnot rained for the last three years.  The people there are surviving on a meal per day for three \\ndays. The situation is so bad, and it calls for urgent and immediate Government intervention.  \\nWe saw the President launch relief supplies to the drought-stricken areas the other day. \\nI,  however,  want  to  tell  this  House  that  these  supplies  are  yet  to  reach  Ganze.  I  urge  the \\nconcerned people to make sure that the relief supplies reach the people of Ganze who suffering \\nvery much in the soonest time possible. \\n\\n  Ganze is blessed with seasonal rivers; and when it rains, a lot of water flows into the \\nocean. If there is a way this water can be preserved it can go a long way in alleviating the water \\nshortages that are being experienced Ganze right now. It is against this background that I ask \\nthe Government to immediately start the construction of the Rare Dam. This is a dam whose \\nfeasibility study was done a long time ago and a design was done but I can say that this report \\nis lying somewhere at the Ministry of Water gathering dust yet nothing has been done on the \\nground.  If this dam  is  constructed it can go a long way in  making sure that there is  enough \\nwater for use both by humans and livestock keepers in Ganze.  \\n\\nThe drought situation in Ganze has been compounded by the fact that there has been an \\ninvasion of elephants in human settlements. We are facing a serious human wildlife  conflict \\nwhich also needs immediate intervention to help the situation. As it is right now, even if it rains \\nnow, nothing can grow in the fields because the elephants are loose and will destroy the crops. \\nI also urge the Government to come up with long-term solutions including, if possible, fencing \\noff Tsavo East to contain the animals in the reserve and enable the farmers to do their farming \\nwithout interruptions from the wild animals.  \\n\\nThere are many challenges that are facing Ganze right now including poor education \\n\\ncompounded by the fact that children are dropping out... \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you Member for Ganze. I now call upon the Member \\n\\nfor West Mugirango. \\n\\nHon.  Stephen  Mogaka  (West  Mugirango,  JP):  Thank  you,  Hon  Deputy  Speaker.  I \\nwould like to take the earliest opportunity to congratulate you and the Hon. Speaker on your \\nwell-deserved election as our Hon. Speaker and Hon. Deputy Speaker. I in particular celebrate \\nyou, on behalf of my class that you had the honour to teach Civil Procedure during my second \\nyear at The University of Nairobi. My Name is Hon. Stephen Mogaka. I am an Accountant, \\nBanker and an Advocate of the High Court of Kenya. Those are the skills the people of West \\nMugirango  saw  fit  to  present  to  this  House  for  use  as  part  of  the  solution  provision  for  the \\npeople of Kenya. For that reason, I have the humble opportunity of thanking the people of West \\nMugirango for coming out in large numbers and voting me in overwhelmingly. I promise I will \\nnot let them down. I am in fact a miracle Member of Parliament (MP) because from the ward \\nI hail from in West Mugirango there has never been an MP except for nine months only when \\nthe late George Justus Morara served and died in a road accident. Prior to that my other ward \\nMember,  Hon.  Thomas  Mong\\xe2\\x80\\x99are,  had  also  died  within  one  year  of  election.  May  God  rest \\ntheir spirits in eternal peace. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I am hoping that Mr. Mutyambai and George Kinoti tendered \\ntheir resignations. This is not what we are going to be subjected to in the Republic of Kenya. \\nThrough this House, Hon Deputy Speaker, I am pleading with the investigating agencies to get \\ndown to the bottom of what, and who killed Madam Lydia and have them brought to book as \\nsoon as practicable.  \\n\\nSpeaking  of  the  drought  ravaging  this  country,  it  has  been  a  vicious  cycle  in  the \\nRepublic of Kenya every other season. I sympathise with our compatriots in the Arid and Semi-\\nArid  Lands  (ASAL)  and  request  that  this  country  gets  a  permanent  solution  to  the  drought \\nproblems.  As  I  speak  of  drought,  the  area  I  represent  of  West  Mugirango  is  within  the \\nconvectional rain region of Lake Victoria. As the sun burns the rest of Kenya, the convectional \\ncurrents go a mock and the Gusii region is only ravaged every other day with hailstorms which \\ndestroy  food  crop.  Never  have  I  heard  about  the  possible  compensation  of  victims  of \\nhailstorms. In the last two weeks areas like Bosamaro and parts of Bonyamatuta Wards suffered \\nserious  hailstorms,  and  coming  with  those  hailstorms  is  hunger  because  the  food  crops  are \\ndestroyed. The cash crops - tea, coffee and pyrethrum - are also destroyed. I will be proposing \\nan amendment to the Disaster Act of this country that when we talk about drought, the flip side \\nof  it  is  always  hailstorms  and  heavy  rains  which  wash  away  soils  and  create  floods  for  our \\nneighbours in the Nyando region. \\n\\n Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  as  we  join  this  13th Parliament  I  celebrate  the  speech  by  His \\nExcellency President William Ruto particularly when he admitted that  this country is broke. \\nAs a result of this brokenness... \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Kajiado East. \\nHon.  Kakuta  Maimai  (Kajiado  East,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker  for \\ngiving  me  this  opportunity.  We  have  been  sitting  here  for  the  past  one  week  and  I  was \\nwondering  whether  my  card  was  not  working.  However,  I  am  very  pleased  to  have  this \\nopportunity. I congratulate you for being appointed as the Hon. Deputy Speaker of this House. \\nI  also  congratulate  our  Speaker,  Hon.  Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula.  We  look  forward  to  supporting  you  to \\ndeliver what we need to deliver to Kenyans. \\n\\nI want to take this opportunity to thank my people of Kajiado East Constituency for \\nelecting me as their MP to represent them and bring them development. I would like to thank \\nmy family for their unconditional support as well as my friends in the Diaspora community \\nwhere  I  was  living  in  the  United  States  of  America  (USA).  Many  of  us  wish  to  have  the \\nopportunity to return to Kenya ad help in ways that we can. When I told them that I was going \\nto vie for this seat, many of them expressed a great deal of support and encouragement as they \\nall also wish that they could find ways to help our country.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker I was very pleased to hear a strong emphasis on food production \\nby our President. This country is obviously suffering due to lack of sufficient food supply and \\nI hope that with his food policies and focus on agriculture we will, one day, be able to supply \\nenough food to our people. It is very sad to see that every year, generations after generations \\ncontinue to face food shortage and many of our people struggle due to lack of food. I hope that \\nwith policies of this administration, the set food subsidies that he is giving to our population \\nand the fertilizers to our farmers will yield good results for our communities.  \\n\\n  Although the recent fertiliser subsidy was very good, I also wish to see subsidies being \\ngiven for animal feeds so that our pastoral communities can afford them for their livestock. I \\nhope  that  moving  forward  and  considering  the  dire  situation  of  drought  in  the  country,  our \\nGovernment will be able to come up with subsidies for animal feeds so that our communities \\nthat feed their livestock can benefit. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

There is lack of enough grass. Last weekend, we went to my home and found six \\ncows being helped because they could not stand ue to lack of grass. Our people are struggling \\nto feed their families and their livestock, and you can see a dire situation happening. Children \\nare struggling in schools. I hope that in this House, with our new administration, we can work \\ncollectively to find measures and ways to help our people so that they can come out of poverty.  \\n \\nI heard many folks from pastoral communities say that livestock farming is becoming \\nvery  difficult  in  arid  lands.  It  is  my  hope  that  our  Government,  together  with  our  National \\nAssembly, will be able to come up with ways on how to mitigate drought because having our \\npeople  depending  on  relief  food  every  year  is  not  sustainable.  I  also  wish  to  have  seen  the \\nPresident  talking  about  environmental  conservation  because  we  need  to  restore  our \\nenvironment, grow more trees and find ways to cope with climate.  \\n \\nand we look forward to days where we can find ways\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Keiyo North.  \\n \\n \\nHon. Adams Korir (Keiyo North, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. This being my \\nfirst time to speak in this House, first, I want to thank the Almighty God for giving me this \\nopportunity. I also thank the people of Keiyo North Constituency for electing me to this House \\nto  represent  them.  People  from  Kapchemutwo  Ward,  Mutei,  Sergoit,  and  across  the \\nconstituency, I want to tell them I am here as their voice.  \\n \\nI also wish to assure my people that I will represent them diligently and work with \\nall State agencies to ensure that electricity supply goes to all parts of the constituency. We have \\nprojects in my constituency like Kamariny Stadium, which have not been completed by the last \\nregime because of challenges here and there. But under this Government, I am sure that we are \\ngoing to complete it.  \\nI do not want to forget my mentor, Hon. Senator, Kipchumba Murkomen, whom I \\n \\nworked under for 10 years as his Personal Assistant. I thank him wherever he is for mentoring \\nme to this level that I represent the people of my constituency.  \\n \\nTo conclude on that, I also want to thank my family and my campaign team and in a \\nspecial way my father, Mr. Yussuf Keitany, who unsuccessfully ran three times to represent \\nour people.  I thank God he is alive and he is seeing me here representing the people he wanted \\nto represent. I say thank you.  \\n \\nOn  this  Motion,  drought  has  affected  many  parts  of  our  country  especially  Kerio \\nValley. First, we need to look at the effects of this drought. Children are no longer going to \\nschool because they are concentrating on finding something to eat. Education standard has also \\ngone down because of that.  \\nWe have seen deaths both in human and in livestock. People are suffering by losing \\n \\ntheir loved ones and livestock. So, this issue is dire. We know that serious intervention needs \\nto  be  put  in  place.  The  same  drought  has  even  caused  insecurity.  All  the  fighting  that  is \\nhappening in Kerio Valley and many parts in the Horn of Kenya is as a result of drought. People \\nwho do not have anything to eat are now resulting to doing things which are inhuman. That is \\nwhy I am saying measures should be put in place. We need to move away from rain-fed farming \\nto irrigation so as to be food secure.  In my constituency, we have Arror and Kimwarer Dam \\nwhich we are sure that if it had been constructed, we would have had much supply of food \\nwhich would eventually assist our people.  \\n \\nI am sure that many Members in this House are also getting a lot of grievances from \\ntheir constituents who are asking for support in terms of food and many other forms of support. \\nGoing  forward,  I  wish  this  House  will  consider  good  budget  so  that  our  farmers  can  be \\nmotivated to increase production. If a farmer can get good money at the end of selling his or \\nher produce, that will motivate him or her to increase production and in the long run we will \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy  Speaker:  Member  for  Dadaab  and,  thereafter,  we  will  have  the \\nMember for Makueni. I know that you have been having challenges with your card. You better \\nhave someone help you with it because you will be next. Member for Dadaab? \\nHon.  Farah  Maalim  (Dadaab,  WDM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker  for \\n \\nallowing  me  to  contribute  on  this  Motion.  I  also  join  my  other  colleagues  who  have \\ncongratulated you and the Speaker of the 13th Parliament, Hon. Moses Masika Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula, for \\nhaving been elected as Deputy Speaker and Speaker respectively.  \\n \\nI stand in this place, the same place where I stood almost 30 years ago when we had \\nexactly the same problems that we have now. For the longest time, the people from the Arid \\nand Semi-Arid areas of this country have been subjected to, and have been at the mercy of the \\nvagaries of weather. The Government, at Independence, started off at the wrong note. We had \\nwhat was called Sessional Paper No.10 of 1965 whose gist was what I call intensification of \\ninvestment  of  the  Government  and  country  in  the  high  potential  areas  and  absolutely  no \\nmention of low potential areas. The gist of that Sessional Paper was that the Government ended \\nup investing nothing in those areas to try and promote agriculture or the mainstay of the lives \\nof those people.  \\n \\nWe are going through the same cycle 58 years later, from 1965. I have personally had \\nthe  pleasure  of  trying  to  deal  with  the  issue  of  drought  in  my  ways  when  I  was  in  the  10th \\nParliament and got the best results that anybody would ever get those days.  \\n \\nFor those who are not from pastoral immigrants, I will tell you that the problem with \\nthis kind of weather is that there are limited number of water points because the livestock will \\ncongregate in that place and eat all the pasture. So, the area itself becomes totally degraded and \\ndoes not have any pasture. But because there is no water where the pasture is, and there is no \\npasture where the water is, animals have to travel for two or three days to look for pasture. \\nAnimals like cattle can only stay for three days without water. They then have to walk back to \\nwhere the water was, and they die on the way. That is why you see the kind of stuff you are \\nseeing right now. \\n\\n In the drought of 2010 and 2011, I engaged 59 water bowers in my constituency, using \\nboth the emergency component in the National Government Constituencies Development Fund \\n(NG-CDF)  as  well  as  some  other  powerful  donors  that  came  on  board.  In  those  days,  that \\nincluded the Millennium Villages Programme, which was partly in my constituency. Not only \\nwere we able to save the livestock in their entirety, but they were so strong that we could sell \\nthem  in  the  market  and  fetch  very  good  prices  because  we  were  taking  water  to  where  the \\npasture was. The animals stayed where there was pasture. \\n\\n It is not rocket science for the Government to adopt such strategies to try and protect \\nthe livestock because everybody eats meat. We had lunch today and there was meat. There is \\nmutton, goat meat, beef and camel meat, which is extremely delicious. Why is it that we have \\nnever had a Government that seriously undertakes to make sure that this sector of the economy \\nis protected in the same way that tea, coffee and all other agricultural crops are protected? \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: You may have one minute to finish your sentence. \\nHon.  Farah  Maalim  (Dadaab,  WDM  -  K):  There  you  go.  Thank  you  for  the  one \\nminute. Being a former Deputy Speaker who has been out of Parliament for the last 10 years, \\nfor one reason or the other, I took a little bit longer.  \\n\\nThe idea is, for God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake, let us get a Government that cares for these people and this \\nsector of the economy for once. For once, the ideas and strategies are in abundance. If you go \\nto Namibia, you will find that they have the biggest ranches. They have the best beef. They \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Theirs is even more \\narid than ours, but because of Government intervention, the fact that there is water everywhere \\nand they grow grass, they are able to benefit from that. It is the same thing in Botswana and a \\nnumber  of  other  countries.  We  tried  to  do  something  in  Galana-Kulalu  but  because  of \\ncorruption, all the money was wasted\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Let us have the Member for Makueni. After that, \\n\\nkindly help the Member for Kajiado South as he keeps going off. \\n\\nHon. Suzanne Kiamba (Makueni, WDM - K): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for \\ngiving me this opportunity. This is my first time to speak in this Parliament. I sincerely feel \\nvery honoured.  \\n\\nFirst, I am very grateful to God for giving me this opportunity to be in this Parliament. \\n\\nSometimes it takes the grace of God to go through a political process.  \\n\\nSecondly, I thank the great people of Makueni Constituency for electing me as the first \\nwoman Member of Parliament. I assure them that I will be their representative and I will do \\nwhat it takes to make a difference in their lives and households. I felt greatly honoured by the \\nconfidence they demonstrated in me. We have had nine men serving as Members of Parliament \\nsince elections started in Makueni Constituency. I am the first woman to be elected. I feel very \\nprivileged. To the women in Makueni, feel that your voices have reached the national level. I \\nassure you that your voices will be heard.  \\n\\nMakueni  Constituency  is  one  of  the  biggest  constituencies  in  this  country  with  a \\npopulation of 194,000 people. It goes far beyond the national figure of 70,000. I pray that we \\nwill  be  considered  when  the  process  for  delineation  of  constituencies  comes  to  this  House \\nbecause fair representation is part of reflection of equity.  \\n\\nMakueni Constituency is one of the semi-arid constituencies in this country. As today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nMotion suggests, it faces quite a number of challenges related to drought. Some of the major \\nchallenges include inadequate water as a result of unreliable rainfall. I am happy to report that \\nwe are very happy as a constituency because the national Government has invested in one of \\nthe biggest dams in our constituency - Thwake Dam. The only challenge is that it has taken six \\nyears to complete. Each year, the budget goes down and it has to be reallocated. If this project \\nwas  taken  with  the  seriousness  that  it  deserves,  my  people  would  not  be  facing  the  kind  of \\nchallenges they are facing today.  \\n\\nAs the Motion implies, if you go to Makueni now, we have a school drop-out rate of \\nabout 30 per cent. Children cannot go to school because they are too hungry. If you look at the \\nmothers, you do not have to be a scientist to know that they are emaciated because of the kind \\nof strain they are going through. If the Government concentrated on such projects like Thwake \\nDam and they were fast-tracked to deliver the desired results, we would make a big difference \\nin this country. \\n\\nThe  other  major  challenge  we  have  in  this  Constituency  is  poor  infrastructure, \\nespecially  electricity and the road network. My  Constituency has less than 40 kilometres of \\ntarmacked  road.  That  is  why  I  was  very  happy  when  the  President  talked  about  wanting  to \\ndislodge ethnicity in his opening speech. Dislodging ethnicity is not just a campaign slogan. It \\nmeans  we  develop  this  country  holistically.  When  we  share  resources  equally  and  share \\nprojects as per the need, that is dislodging ethnicity. If dislodging ethnicity is only a slogan to \\nbe used during campaigns and elections, we will be far from addressing some of the emerging \\nneeds in our constituencies. \\n\\nThe other major challenge as a result of the water issue, is food insecurity, which leads \\n\\nto low incomes. So, if we solve that problem of water, by the national\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Let her finish her sentence. \\nHon.

Speaker on your election to serve the 13th Parliament as our \\nleaders. Second, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people of Kajiado South and \\nmy family for trusting me and electing me to represent them in this House. \\n\\nKajiado  South  has  its  own  uniqueness.  We  are  on  the  agricultural  slope  of  Mt. \\nKilimanjaro. We also neighbour Amboseli Game Reserve and Tsavo National Park. Kajiado \\nSouth  faces  several  challenges.  I  want  to  mention  a  few  because  of  time.  Like  many  other \\nyoung people in the Republic of Kenya, the  youth in  Loitoktok are facing unemployment. I \\nthank the President for the initiative of lifting blacklisting on Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) \\nand the proposal of the Hustler Fund to take care of women and unemployed youth.  \\n \\nWe face a lot of challenges in education. The education system is not functioning in our \\nplace. We do not have the required number of teachers. We also have challenges with electricity \\nand water supply, making education a problem in rural areas. We also have a problem with \\nroad network. We do not have good roads. The main road that is supposed to serve us between \\nKajiado County and Taita Taveta County is Ilasit-Taveta road. It has a lot of economic benefits \\nto our country. It serves Tanzania at the border and Mombasa in terms of food supply. Being a \\nconstituency leading in production of tomatoes and onions, I think that road will do us good \\nand promote the economy in our place. \\n \\nThere  is  another  challenge.  During  the  campaign  period,  we  promised  the  people  to \\nopen  the  Loitoktok/Tarakia  Border  Post.  In  the  whole  country,  Kajiado  South  is  the  only \\nconstituency with a border post that operates for 12 hours while other border posts operate for \\n24 hours.  \\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Proceed. I will hear the point of order later. \\n \\nHon. Parashina Sakimba (Kajiado South, ODM): Thank you. On the subject that is \\non the Floor of the House today, Kajiado County is approximately 22,000 square kilometres. \\nIt is also categorised as an ASAL region. About 80 per cent of the land is ASAL. There is a \\nproblem with livestock production and crop farming.  I plead with this House and the whole \\nRepublic to declare drought in those areas as an emergency in the country. In the short-term, \\nwe  should  be  supplied  with  hay  and  vaccines.  Kenya  Wildlife  Service  (KWS)  needs  to  do \\nsomething. People also need food relief. In future, pastoralists should be taken care of in terms \\nof a livestock insurance scheme. We should also consider cultivating crops that can do well in \\nshort rains. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, thank you so much. I appreciate. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Isiolo South has a point of order. I could not tell \\n\\n \\nyour face earlier and you had not inserted your card. \\n\\nHon. Bidu Mohamed (Isiolo South, JP): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. While I \\nthank Hon. Ali Wario for moving this Motion, is it in order? The Motion is more or less open \\nended.  We  are  discussing  drought.  I  thought  the  last  sentence  should  read  that  we  declare \\ndrought a national disaster. What the Motion says is that we discuss the issue. We have to think \\nof a resolution. The resolution should be that this House declares drought a national disaster.  \\nIs the Motion in order? \\n\\nThank you. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker: Hon. Member, I was not on the Chair when this began but I \\n \\ncan see that it was allowed under Standing Order 33 on Adjournment of the House on a definite \\nmatter of urgent national importance. The Motion is about the drought ravaging most parts of \\nthe country. Members are ventilating and debating that particular issue. The Motion does not \\nprovide any resolution. \\n \\n\\n(A Member spoke off the record) \\n\\nHon.  Member,  kindly  sit  down  and  press  the  intervention  button.  I  will  give  you  an \\n\\n  \\n \\nopportunity to speak. I can hear your voice, but I cannot see your name on the console. \\n \\nActually,  I think you are being disrespectful to the Speaker. I have asked you not to \\nshout out loud but to insert your card. I will find your name and call upon you to speak. I am \\nabout to do that. But if you continuously shout, then I will not even ask what your name is. \\nYou are seated too far and I cannot see you from here. We are still new in the House, and I am \\nstill learning your names and faces. So, allow me to use the available technology to identify \\nyou.  I  am  kindly  asking  you  to  be  polite  enough  to  allow  that  to  happen.  That  is  all.  It  is \\noffensive if you keep shouting. \\nMember for Wajir North, you can raise your point of order. \\n \\nHon. Ibrahim Saney (Wajir North, ODM): Hon. Deputy Speaker, I apologise. On the \\n \\nFloor is the Member for Wajir North, your proposer and a constituent who voted for you. I did \\nnot intend in any way to annoy you but to contribute constructively. \\n\\nOn the point of relevance, this House adjourned for a special Motion on the effects of \\ndrought. We are being mesmerised by maiden speeches. Could you kindly guide us so that we \\ncan contribute to the Motion on the drought ravaging ASAL counties in the country? We need \\nto speak to issues rather than make maiden speeches, which can be made at any time. It is about \\nrelevance. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Member, I realise that some Members contributing to the \\nMotion are making their maiden speeches in a few sentences then they move on to talk about \\ndrought. Let us not stop them. \\n\\nWe  will  now  proceed.  Let  us  have  the  honourable  Member  for  Marsabit.  Hon.  TJ \\nKajwang\\xe2\\x80\\x99, I cannot see your card here on intervention. I can just hear your voice. Honourable \\nMember for Marsabit, proceed.  \\n \\nme to add my voice to this very important statement. \\n\\nHon. Naomi Waqo (Marsabit, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for allowing \\n\\nI congratulate the Member who has brought it. It is quite relevant to many of us. Maybe \\nthat  is  why  you  see  some  people  getting  emotional.  It  is  affecting  us  and  some  people  are \\nalready losing lives. The situation is so bad at the moment. As a result of the drought, some \\nschool-going children are fainting in classrooms. Others are not going to school at all. Lactating \\nmothers and pregnant women are getting sick and weaker. We have children under the age of \\nfive who are already malnourished and the situation is getting worse every day. The elderly are \\nthe most affected. There are people who have already lost lives and others cannot even wake \\nup from their beds. While in the 12th Parliament, while I was in Senate, I remember we debated \\nover this matter about two times. According to my observation, drought comes after every three \\nyears. This time round it is quite serious. For the last four seasons, many areas have not received \\nrains. That means the situation is worse than any other time we have had drought. That is why \\nwe are requesting that it be declared famine so that it receives the attention it deserves.  \\n \\nIn most of our areas, water is a real problem. We do not have enough boreholes or clean \\nwater. People who are already weak cannot fetch water for themselves because they trek for \\nabout 20 kilometres to fetch water. Proper planning needs to be done so that we have enough \\nwater dams, water pans and boreholes. Water is everything; water is life. Right now, animals \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Human  beings  are  also  dying.  As  many \\nMembers have already said, there is no good network. When we talk of food security, what \\ncomes to our minds are human beings. For a pastoralist, the life of a cow is more important \\neven than the life of a human being. As they feed themselves right now, many people even \\ncook for their animals. This is food that they do not have. They end up giving to their animals \\nthe little they receive as their relief food. Proper planning by the Government and the nation \\ncan help us. We can plan if we create a Ministry of Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) to take \\ncare  of  ASALs  and  their  needs.  In  the  next  20  years,  and  with  proper  planning,  we  can  be \\nharvesting water and planting crops. We can do irrigation where necessary so that we can at \\nleast be able to feed enough people.  \\n \\nThe lands of our friends from this other side of the country is the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s food basket. \\nThat food can be bought and transferred to needy areas like Northern Kenya, where we do not \\nplant and harvest enough food. That is so that people on the ground, can be able to buy enough \\nfood for themselves and their families when the need comes. Right now, people are dying and \\nthe food being distributed goes through a real process where committees have their shares and \\nother people in between have their shares. Sometimes relief food finds itself in the market and \\nneedy people have to buy it.  \\n \\n036. You were misbehaving earlier on. \\n \\nHon. TJ Kajwang\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Ruaraka, ODM): Hon. Deputy Speaker, you now see the kind of \\nproblems we have on the Floor. It is not an isolated problem. I think it is good for the Clerk to \\norganise for some technicians to go round checking these facilities. Sometimes we think that \\nwe  have  pressed  the  buttons  but  we  are  not  seen  on  the  board.  Members  here  are  anxious \\nthinking that they are not being seen. I think the Clerk should organise. That is administrative.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Honourable Member, as long as we agree, when that happens \\nyou just walk to the Clerks-at-the-Table and they should get the Serjeants-At-Arms to help you \\nas opposed to shouting your point of order aloud. \\n \\nHon. TJ Kajwang\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Ruaraka, ODM): Hon. Deputy Speaker, point taken. I am the last \\nperson to misbehave in this House. I have enough years in my distinction and my activity in \\nthis House has been fairly distinguished. I am very sorry. I apologise. \\n \\nI really wanted to raise the point. It is during debate on a presidential speech and during \\na  Motion  for  Adjournment  when  new  Members  learn.  They  will  not  learn  some  of  these \\ndebating skills if sometimes people who have been here for one or more terms do not point out \\nsome of the issues.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Ruaraka, I can now see  your card. It is number \\n\\nI was rising on a point of information. I wanted to inform the Member who rose and \\nstated that, in his opinion, the Order should have concluded with a resolution of the House in \\nsome manner. Quite confidently, another Member rose and thought that some Members were \\nout of order in so far as relevance was concerned. That was the only issue I wanted to put my \\nmind to. \\n\\nFirstly, a Motion on Adjournment is a wide Motion. Members get to speak about things \\nthat are so generally related to that issue and it is just that. It ends there. It does not have a \\nresolution. It is a Motion which helps Members to ventilate their hearts out without necessarily \\nhaving  a  position  on  a  resolution.  A  resolution  must  come  as  a  matter  of  Motion  where  a \\nMember proposes a Motion in which the House resolves to do something. You are a Member \\nhere and your role is to represent the electorate. How will your people know that you are taking \\na position if you do not rise and say something, however general it may be, without a resolution \\nmade on the Motion? That is the matter I wanted to raise my mind on. For the Member who \\nthought that Members were irrelevant, it is never irrelevant for a new Member to say anything. \\nA maiden speech is a maiden speech even when you want to thank your mother for giving birth \\nto you to be elected to come to this House. That is the beauty of debate. A debate should be \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Therefore, you can say anything and everything that then allows you to \\nspeak.  \\n \\nI just wanted to tell Members what the Speaker said, as you rightly said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that, a new \\nMember should not be interrupted. Let him speak and run his time. After that you can take him \\non. Even though  you think that he is not relevant, when your time comes, you will rise and \\nspeak all those relevant things you want to speak.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you, Member for Ruaraka. I now call upon the Member \\n \\nfor  Mombasa  County.  Assist  her  with  her  microphone.  She  has  been  trying  all  day  and \\nyesterday. \\n\\nHon.  Zamzam  Mohammed  (Mombasa  County,  ODM):  Asante  sana  Mhe.  Naibu \\n\\nSpika. Ninakupongeza kwa nafasi uliyoipata kama Naibu Spika wetu. Pongezi sana.  \\n\\nKuhusu maswala ya ukame na yale yanayogusia wenzetu wa Kaskazini Mashariki hasa, \\nkuna  mjadala  mzito  ambao  umeletwa  na  Mjumbe  wetu  wa  Garsen,  Mhe.  Ali  Wario. \\nNingependa kuwaelezea kwa kina. Wengine wetu hapa pengine tunajadili tu ilhali hali halisi \\niliyoko  kule  mashinani  hatuijui.  Kuna  mama  ambaye  mtoto  wake  atakapokufa,  atawalisha \\nwengine huo mwili kama kitoweo cha nyama. Hiyo ni hali tata na ngumu sana. Ningependa \\nkuishauri Serikali. Sijui ni kwa nini tunachukua madeni mengi sana nje lakini mambo yale ya \\nmuhimu  katika  taifa  hili  hatuyaangalii  kwa  kina?  Imekuwa  miaka  mingi  tangu  watu  wa \\nKaskazini Mashariki walie juu ya ukame, watoto wao na mifugo kufa, mifugo wanahangaika \\nilhali  hapa  Bungeni  tunakunywa  chai,  tunakula  chakula  cha  mchana  na  jioni  tunapotoka \\ntunapata chai.  Imekuwaje Wakenya wanahangaika sana kule Kaskazini Mashariki na katika \\nsehemu zingine kame? \\n\\nNingependa kuishauri Serikali kwamba inasikitisha sana kuwa tumeweza kukopa pesa \\nkwa  wingi  mpaka  imefika  trilioni  kadhaa.  Hizi  pesa  tunapozikopa  inafaa  tuziweke  kwenye \\nmabomba ya maji kutoka sehemu ambako kuna maji na tuyapeleke hadi sehemu za Kaskazini \\nMashariki ili tuweze kufanya unyunyizaji ili wakazi waweze kukuza mimea, wanyama wapate \\nchakula na watu wa Kaskazini Mashariki waseme \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckwaheri\\xe2\\x80\\x9d kwa hali halisi ya njaa na ukame.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\nNingependa kusisitiza sana maana hili si jambo ndogo bali ni kubwa sana na linatuhusu \\nsote.  Kama  Wabunge,  tunafaa  kushikana  kwa  huu  Mswada  maana  wenzetu  wako  na  msiba \\nmkubwa sana ilhali wao pia ni Wakenya. Tunafaa kushauriana na pia tuangalie kile tuko nacho \\nmfukoni  mwetu  ili  tuwasaidie  hasa  wakati  kama  ambapo  Serikali  inadai  haina  pesa,  jambo \\nambalo linatatiza zaidi.  \\n\\nJanga la njaa ni dharura kubwa, kama unavyoashiria Mjadala huu wa leo. Ninaomba \\nSerikali  ya  Kenya  itilie  maanani  na  kulishughulikia  jambo  hili  kwa  kina.  Pia,  ningependa \\nkuwaeleza watu wangu wa Mwakirunge, ambao wamo humo humo, kuwa; ijapokua haionekani \\nzaidi, pia nao wanahangaishwa na njaa. Baa la njaa limeshika sehemu kubwa katika taifa hili. \\nWatu  wengi  ni  maskini,  hawana  makazi  na  hawajui  watashika  mti  gani.  Kwa  hivyo, \\nningependa  kuwashauri  tuangalie  zile  sehemu  zilizoathirika  na  njaa  ili  tuweze  kuweka \\nmsukumo utakaomaliza hili janga kabisa. Tusiwe tu watu wa kujadili swala hili kila siku ndani \\nya  Bunge.  Serikali  inafaa  iwajibike,  pesa  zikija  watu  waache  kuitapeli  na  tuache  kuwa  na \\nutapeli katika pesa za Serikali maanake utapeli ndio unaoleta matatizo zaidi. Pesa hizi zitumike \\nkatika sehemu mwafaka na hitajika ili tuweze kufikia malengo ya kuweza kuwa na taifa huru \\nbila njaa. \\n\\nJambo lingine ambalo ningezungumzia katika sehemu hizi ni kuhusu mayatima ambao \\nwanahangaika sana. Zamani tulikuwa na mfuko wa mayatima. Sasa hivi na hili janga la njaa, \\nmayatima  pia  wanahangaika.  Kama  mama  msimamizi  wa  Mombasa  Kaunti,  ningependa \\nkusema kuwa mayatima waangaliwe na wapewe mfuko utakaowawezesha kujisaidia.  \\n\\nNitakalolizungumzia  la  mwisho  ni  juu  ya  wakulima.  Inapofika  wapewe  mbolea, \\nwahusika wasiangalie sehemu moja bali wakulima wote katika taifa zima. Kuna sehemu nyingi \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Lakini kwa vile\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Let us have Hon.  Irene Mayaka, the Nominated Member. \\nHon. Irene Mayaka (Nominated, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. Let me \\nfirst take this opportunity to join my fellow Members in congratulating you, and the Speaker \\non your elections.  \\n\\nI stand here, as a new Member. I would like to take this opportunity to give my Maiden \\nSpeech as I contribute to the Motion at hand. Before you is Hon. Irene Nyakerario Mayaka. \\nMy original home is in Bogichora Ward, West Mugirango County. The ODM home nominated \\nme  to  this  House.  The  young  people  in  our  party  call  me  Renee,  and  I  think  it  is  a  very \\nmelodious name.  \\n\\nI rise on the Floor of this House for the first time in my life. Since childhood, I have \\nharboured ambitions of being a Member of Parliament someday. However, never did I imagine \\nthat  I  would  be  in  the  same  space  with  some  of  the  women  that  I  looked  up  to  as  a  young \\nwoman, like Hon. Millie Mabona who has borrowed from the South African MPs and is now \\nreferred  to  as  Mama  Millie;  and  also  Hon.  Hussein.  Had  it  not  been  for  the  personal \\ncommitment of our political father, the Rtd. Hon. Raila Amolo Odinga, to raise the profile of \\nyoung women in this country, I would still be in our village in Nyamira County.  \\n\\nToday  I  want  the  world  to  witness  the  goodness  of  this  statesman  whom  we,  in  the \\nODM family, fondly refer to as Baba. I am a proud product of the daughters of Raila\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Lobby \\nGroup. The group was formed in 2016 and was adopted by our party to enable young women \\nto be mentored into political leadership. I, therefore, take this opportunity to sincerely thank \\nmy political father who has mentored us in this journey. \\n\\n I also take this opportunity to thank my family for always being supportive even though \\nat first, my father, who is a retired banker, was not so sure about me quitting banking to join \\npolitics. I take this opportunity to also assure the other women that I will always take the ladder \\nback down to them and share the lessons of my political journey.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, as a young person, my commitment to this honourable House is \\nthrough the Kenyan Young Parliamentarians Caucus to champion for policies and laws that \\nwill uplift the living standards of young people in our nation to match with the dynamism and \\nrobust nature of the world they live in. A few years ago, Nokia 3310 was the in thing in the \\nworld. We, therefore, must purpose to have platforms that allow young people to be innovative \\nand catch up with the fast-growing world.  \\n\\nTo my people of Nyamira and Gusii land in general \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the land where God \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshowers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\neveryday as we like to refer to it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I would like to assure you of my commitment to serve you. \\nGusii land is an area where we used to have 11 rivers but because of climate change issues, we \\nnow  have  only  two  rivers.  Unfortunately,  we  are  no  longer  happy  because  of  this  adverse \\nclimatic development. I assure them that I have not come here to sleep. In the next few days, I \\nwill start a process that will enable me table a Motion that will fix this issue.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the late Hon. Okoth championed to  have a law that sought  to \\nlegalise cannabis sativa as a medicinal plant for our people. I would also like to make a promise \\nin honour of his memory that I will continue to ensure that his initiative develops into law.  \\n\\nValue addition will be top of my agenda because good food from our soil is definitely \\nhealthier and better than the Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) option that is now being \\npropagated by our political opponents.  \\n\\nSpeaking of political opponents, Kenya is greater than us. I promise to take them to task \\nfor the good of this nation where necessary, and only for the benefit of Kenya, we will unclench \\nour fists if they unfold their hands.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I  however,  join  my  fellow  Members  in  urging  the  Government  to  embark  on  a \\nspeedy process of ensuring that this issue is resolved. Even though this is kneejerk reaction, it \\nis a solution for the time being as we seek interventions that are more permanent. If we look at \\nthe report from the National Drought Management Authority, we will see that Kenyan students \\nhave come up with interventions that seek to have permanent solutions and... \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: I will give you a minute to finish your eloquent remarks. \\nHon.  Irene  Mayaka  (Nominated,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker.  I \\n\\nappreciate.  \\n\\nOne  of  the  interventions  that  have  been  spoken  about  is  a  vacuum  solar  water \\ndesalination plant along Athi River. We all know that at the baseline of ensuring that we resolve \\nthe drought issues is availability of water.  \\n\\nSecondly, we have hydroponic method of growing plants, where you grow plants from \\npumice soil. These are some of the interventions that we should dare to make if we want to \\nhave permanent solutions for our people, who cover about 42.7 per cent in all the counties in \\nthe country.  \\n\\nWith those remarks, I submit. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker:  Thank you. I now call upon the Member for Turkana Central.   \\nHon. Joseph Emathe (Turkana Central, UDA): Thank you very much, Hon. Deputy \\n\\nSpeaker for granting me this opportunity.  \\n\\nFirst of all, I would like to pay much tribute and thanks to my constituents of Turkana \\nCentral. As I make my Maiden Speech, I thank the Almighty God for this special occasion. I \\nalso send my gratitude to my immediate family: my wife, children, my mother and father. I \\nalso pay my tribute to the persons who made much effort, spent their time and prayed for me. \\nAll  that  I  would  want  to  tell  my  constituents  in  Lodwar  Township,  Kerio-Delta  Ward, \\nKanamkemer Ward, Kalokol Ward and Kan\\xe2\\x80\\x99gatotha Ward is that I am committed to serve them \\nwell.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, allow me, in a special way, with utmost respect, to pay my tribute \\nto the late Hon. George Saitoti, the man who came to Turkana in 1993 as the Vice President of \\nthis country and officiated an Harambee called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTurkana Education Fund\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  The Fund paid \\nthree  years  of  my  school  fees  and  enabled  me  to  take  my  studies  at  one  of  the  prestigious \\nschools in this country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Moi High School, Kabarak.   \\n\\nI remain thankful to my first employer, who considered and gave me the opportunity to \\nserve at World Vision for more than nine years. I also pay tribute to my former Governor, Hon. \\nJosephat Koli Nanok, who gave me an opportunity to serve under his Government for more \\nthan seven years. He actually became one of the pillars that helped me to drive into the political \\narena. \\n\\nIn the same measure, I am also grateful to my predecessors who participated in debates \\nand decisions that were made in this House. I begin with the late Hon. Peter Barnabas Ejore. \\nHe was an Assistant Minister in this country. I also want to pay tribute to the late Hon. Patrick \\nEjore. I also want to recognise Hon. Emmanuel Imana; Hon. Ekwe Ethuro; my last predecessor, \\nHon. Missionary John Lodepe; and to my colleagues, with whom I presently share this honour \\nfor the advice and encouragement that they gave me. They are my constituents and I am sure \\nthat they look forward to my participation and representation in this House.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  during  my  campaign,  I  had  five  agendas  that  I  committed  to \\nserve and deliver to my constituents \\xe2\\x80\\x93 resilience, education bursaries and scholarships for the \\nright skills, universal health coverage, security, investment, environment and partnerships. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I congratulate you and the Speaker of this House. I also want to \\n\\ncongratulate my President, His Excellency William Samoei Ruto. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Tunajua wewe ni mtendakazi. Tunajua kazi yako ni nzuri na tayari ishaanza \\nkuonekana.  \\n\\nKusema kweli, kiangazi kinawatatiza sana watu  wetu; haswa, watu wangu wa Lamu \\nMashariki.  Kiangazi  kimewaathiri  watu  wa  Kiunga  na  watu  wa  Eneo  Wodi  ya  Faza. \\nNingeomba  Wabunge  ama  viongozi  wa  taifa  letu  wasichukulie  hili  janga  la  kiangazi  kama \\njanga la watu fulani tu maana linaathiri watu kutoka nyanja zote. Mfugaji akipata hasara kwa \\nminajili  ya  ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99ombe  wake  kufa,  hatakuwa  na  kitu  cha  kuuza  ili  apate  faida  ili  imuwezeshe \\nkupata hela za kununua mazao. Na iwapo mkulima hataweza kununuliwa mazao, itamuadhiri \\npia maana hataweza kufanya ukulima. Hali hii itachangia janga la njaa, ambalo litaathiri afya \\nna elimu. \\n\\nEndapo  kiangazi  ni  kingi,  ni  lazima  rasilimali  ya  taifa  itumike.  Huduma  za  afya \\nzinatakiwa ziwasilishwe kwa wananchi. Ninawaomba viongozi katika Serikali hii wasione hili \\njanga kama ni la watu wachache tu. \\n\\nMhe. Naibu Spika, katika eneo Bunge la Lamu  Mashariki, ukame unasababishwa na \\nbinadamu. Unasababishwa na ndugu zetu majirani. Hivi sasa nikizungumza, watu wa Lamu \\ntulikuwa tumejipanga vizuri. Tuna vidimbwi vya maji ambavyo tumejengea watu wa Kiunga. \\nLakini  katika  eneo  Bunge  la  Lamu  Mashariki,  ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99ombe  hata  kutoka  Mandera  wako  huko. \\nNg\\xe2\\x80\\x99ombe  zaidi  ya  20,000  kutoka  Garissa  na  Tana  River  wako  malishoni  katika  maeneo  ya \\nmpaka  wa  Kenya  na  Somalia.  Wametuvamia  sisi  watu  wa  Lamu.  Maji  na  nyasi  zile \\nzingeliwasaidia  wafugaji  wetu  hata  wasingepata  shida  ya  ukame.  Lakini  saa  hii  wafugaji \\nkutoka kaunti jirani wamekuja na mifugo wao na kuvamia eneo hilo, na hatuwezi kuwafukuza \\nkwa sababu ni majirani. \\n \\nNasi  pia  sasa  tumekuwa  kwa  janga  hilo  la  ukame  ilhali  tulikuwa  tumejipanga.  Kwa \\nhivyo,  nataka  kuwaambia  majirani  zetu  wa  Garissa,  Tana  River  na  wale  wote  wanaoleta \\nng\\xe2\\x80\\x99ombe  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  hata  wanowabeba  kwa  malori  wakiwaleta  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  wajue  siku  ile  mimi  napigania \\nmabwawa na vitu vingine kupelekwa  Lamu  wao  huwa wako mbele kupigania  Lamu  isipate \\nmabwawa hayo ili wapate wao. Lakini saa hii tumeona kwamba yale mabwawa machache ya \\nLamu  ndiyo  wanayoyafuata.  Kwa  hivyo,  Mhe.  Naibu  wa  Spika,  mimi  ningeomba  Serikali \\niweze  kuangalia  yale  maeneo  ambayo  yatakuwa  yakiwafaa  wengine.  Pesa  zilitolewa \\nyakajengwa mabwawa lakini mvua haikunyesha kule. Mvua imenyesha mahali kama Lamu, \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Sasa iwe ni mtindo, Lamu tuwekewe mabwawa na vidimbwi zaidi ndiyo \\nwakati wa ukame majirani wetu waweze kuja kutumia maji hayo bila kutuadhiri sisi.  \\n \\nKwa  hivyo,  nyinyi  mnaoniangalia  vizuri,  tena  watu  wangu  majirani  wa  Garissa, \\nmhakikishe, maanake nyinyi ndio wa kwanza, tukipata hivyo vidimbwi vinavuta Garissa zaidi \\nkuliko Lamu. Na hivyo ndivyo vitu vinawafaa. Saa hii watu wangu wanatatizika. Changamoto \\nza usalama zinaongezeka kwa sababu ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99ombe na wafugaji ni wengi kwenye misitu, na katika \\nmisitu kama Boni kuna matatizo. Kwa hivyo, mnanipatia kazi ngumu mno. Kwa sasa hivi ni \\nwakati mgumu kwa watu wa Lamu, haswa watu wa Kiunga. Kule kwenyewe kuna shida za \\nkiusalama ilhali watu na mifugo wanakuja kwa wingi kudhoofisha usalama zaidi. Kwa hivyo, \\nwakati mwingine mnapopanga jambo lolote kama jambo la msaada kwa upande wa kiangazi, \\nitabidi muihusishe Lamu maana mwafahamu kuwa sisi ndiyo wenyeji wenu. Inafaa Lamu ipate \\nmgao mwingi zaidi ili iweze kuwakaribisha hadi wageni wakati wa kiangazi.  \\n\\nAhsante Mhe. Naibu wa. Spika. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Ahsante sana. I call upon the Member for Kitutu Chache North. \\nHon.  Japheth  Nyakundi  (Kitutu  Chache  North,  UDA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy \\n\\n \\n \\nSpeaker for giving me an opportunity to address this august House.  \\n\\n \\n\\nFirst of all, I thank God for the opportunity he has given me to be here today. Secondly, \\nI  congratulate  you  and  Hon.  Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula  for  being  elected  Deputy  Speaker  and  Speaker, \\nrespectively.  I  congratulate  the  President  and  the  Deputy  President  respectively  for  being \\nelected. I thank them for being there for me during my election. I thank the President so much \\nfor believing, trusting and walking with me throughout the journey during this election. \\n \\nI also thank the people of Kitutu Chache North Constituency for believing and voting \\nfor me as a young person. I want to tell them that being in this august House, I will represent \\nthem faithfully as they deserve. I also want to thank the former Member of Parliament, Hon. \\nJimmy Nuru Angwenyi, who has been here for more than 25 years. I understand that Members \\nof the 12th Parliament used to call him the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrandfather of the House.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I have so much respect \\nfor him. I really thank him. I will try to fit in his shoes because he is one person who has worked \\nfor the people of Kitutu Chache North for far too long.  \\n\\nI want to thank the President for his resolve to have Cabinet Secretaries coming to this \\nHouse to respond to Questions that will be raised by Members. This is with regard to the roads \\nin my constituency. There is a road that was started back in 2016 and stopped in the same year. \\nThis is the road that goes from Nyamukumba to Ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99enyi, Bobaracho, Monyerero, Ragogo and \\nTambacha  to  Marani.  I  believe  when  the  Cabinet  Secretaries  come  to  this  House  to  answer \\nQuestions, it will be easier for me as a Member of Parliament to ask questions and to know \\nwhy the contractor has not finished the road six years down the line.  \\n\\nAs the Member of Kitutu Chache North, I want to tell my constituents that I will work \\n\\nwith them and make sure that whatever they want passed in the House, is done.  \\n\\nLastly, on the issue to do with the Hustler Fund, I thank the President so much because \\nwith that fund coming along, the young people of this country will be able to get funds so that \\nthey can establish their own businesses. We believe that the young people of this country will \\nbenefit through this fund.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I am pleased that the President has reduced the price of fertilisers \\nfrom Kshs6,500 to Kshs3500 per bag. With that reduction, farmers in my Kisii County will be \\nable to produce more in terms of maize and other crops. This will make more food available \\nfor distribution to residents in ASALs, who are complaining of drought that has  led to food \\ndeficiency. This will feed people in those areas because of the issues that they are undergoing. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity. \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Thank  you.  If  you  are  the  one  who  has  sent  home  the \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrandfather of the National Assembly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, then you have set the bar quite high.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Is  that  the  correct  pronunciation?  Is  the \\n\\nMember for Mathioya here? \\n\\nget back to you. \\n\\nHon. Edwin Gichuki (Mathoya, UDA): Yes, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Igembe North, I forgot you for a minute but I will \\n\\nProceed, Member for Mathioya. \\nHon. Edwin Gichuki (Mathoya, UDA): Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you for giving \\nme an opportunity to address this House for the first time. Indeed, this is my maiden speech. I \\nwant to congratulate you for your election as the Deputy Speaker and for the election of Hon. \\nMoses Masika Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula as the Speaker of this House. \\n\\n I sincerely give my thanks to the people of Mathioya for giving me the opportunity to \\nserve them in this House. It is an honour given that out of the 50 million Kenyans, I am part of \\nthe 350 that are serving this House.  I thank my family, my wives, my children, my nuclear \\nfamily, my dad and mum \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Mr. and Mrs.  Gichuki \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for the support they gave me. They cheered \\nme on when it was not fashionable to do so. I thank the President and the Deputy President for \\nthe numerous trips they made to Mathioya to come and campaign for me through the United \\nDemocratic Alliance (UDA) party so that my dream could become a reality. Mr. President and \\nyour Deputy wherever you are, I give you my thanks. I want to thank the UDA party for the \\nfree and fair primaries or nominations because without them, I could not be in this House.  \\n\\nOn the debate in the House today about drought, I am privileged to have worked with \\nFood  and  Agriculture  Organisation  (FAO),  which  is  a  United  Nations  body  that  deals  with \\ndrought and food issues. For us to be able to solve the issue of drought, we have to look at the \\nissue of water. We have different types of droughts. We have meteorological drought that is \\ncaused  by  factors  such  as  tsunami,  hurricanes,  typhoons  and  others  natural  phenomena  like \\nlandslides. I know this is happening close to home like in Mozambique and South Africa but \\nfor  now,  it  is  not  affecting  our  country.  We  also  have  another  type  of  drought  called \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chydrological drought\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which is caused lack of by water.  If we manage our water well, we \\nwill not have issues of drought in this country.  \\n\\nWe are currently talking about drought but in three to six, seven or eight months, there \\nwill be flooding in this country yet all that water will go to waste. Some will go to Lake Victoria \\nand some to the Indian Ocean. If we conserve that water through water harvesting using pans, \\ndams and other things, drought will be a thing of the past.   \\n\\nThe other day when His Excellency the President was flagging-off relief food, he said \\nhe hoped that that would be the last time he would be doing so. We know that he has a PhD in \\nAgriculture, and a Masters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 degree in Agriculture. He is passionate about agriculture. Because \\nwe have given him a chance, I am very sure that we will never again discuss drought in this \\nHouse.  \\n\\nThere is also another type of drought called agricultural drought, which causes shortage \\nof food. There are some counties or parts of the country that have excess food while others are \\nsuffering. We have counties that are even wasting food. If we can  improve on our logistical \\nand supply chain mechanisms, we will be able to move food from food-rich counties or areas \\nthat have a surplus of food commodities to counties that do not have food. We will then not \\nhave food shortages.  If we are able to do this, I am sure we will be able to solve some of these \\nproblems. \\n\\nI know that my proposals might be extreme but we need to expand on the sources or \\ntypes  of  food  that  we  eat  in  this  country.  Having  worked  out  of  the  country,  in  Cameroon, \\npeople there\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker:  Thank  you.  I think we had skipped the Member  for  Igembe \\nNorth. After him, we will have Hon. Umulkher Harun, the Nominated Member. We will then \\nhave the Member for Karachuonyo. Make sure that your cards are ready.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Julius M\\xe2\\x80\\x99anaiba (Igembe North, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for \\nthis opportunity. Let me take a cue from my colleagues and congratulate you for being elected \\nas the Deputy Speaker of this House. I also congratulate the Speaker of the National Assembly, \\nHon. Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula Masika. Let me also take this opportunity to congratulate the President and \\nhis Deputy for being unequivocally elected.  Allow me to also congratulate the great people of \\nIgembe for giving me an opportunity to serve them as their Member of the 13th Parliament.  \\nThis is a great honour and I assure them that I will not squander this opportunity. I will serve \\nthem diligently with a lot of commitment and honour. \\n\\nAllow me to give a little background of Igembe North. As the name suggests, Igembe \\nNorth  is  one  of  the  constituencies  at  the  far  end  of  Mount  Kenya.  It  is  the  northern-most \\nconstituency in Meru.  In this regard, it borders  Isiolo County. All the five wards of Igembe \\nNorth touch Isiolo County at one end.  This, therefore, means that the marginal belt of Igembe \\nNorth is quite wide.  \\n\\nIn relation to the Motion before us, we are aware that mapping has been done and some \\ncounties have been mapped as red-alert counties. I would urge the Government to make sure \\nthat, as per the sub-county poverty and drought indices, Igembe North is considered as one of \\nthe sub-counties that should be on the red-alert programme. Igembe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic mainstay is \\nmiraa, an agricultural product. Currently, miraa is not productive in three-quarters of Igembe \\nNorth Constituency. Two weeks ago, one of the sections of Igembe hit the headlines because \\n100 people ate meat of a dead camel. They were hospitalised because of diarrhoea and other \\nrelated problems. I call on the Government to intervene urgently so that people can be given \\nenough food for them to feed their young ones and to also make sure that our children remain \\nin school. I am alive to the fact that distribution of food is already taking place. I would beg \\nthat  the  Government  makes  sure  that  the  food  is  taken  to  schools  instead  of  giving  it  to \\nindividuals. At school, all school-going children will access the food and we shall have less \\nproblems in homesteads. \\n\\nFinally, on infrastructure, I want to assure the people of Igembe North that I know all \\nthe  stalled  projects  concerning  electricity,  roads  and  boreholes.  I  will  fast-track  them  once \\nappointments  have  been  made  in  various  ministries  to  make  sure  that  those  projects  are \\ncompleted. \\n\\nThank you. I can see my time is over. I want to end there. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Nominated Member Hon. Umulkher Harun. \\nHon.  Umulkher  Harun  (Nominated,  ODM):  Thank  you  so  much,  Hon.  Deputy \\nSpeaker,  for  the  opportunity.  I  am  a  young  lady,  nominated  by  the  Orange  Democratic \\nMovement (ODM) party. I am from Garissa County, specifically Ijara Sub-County in Hulugho, \\nwhich borders Somalia to the South.  \\n\\nWe constantly hear about drought but we have not found a solution to date. Is it because \\nwe do not  have the  funds or is  it because we  are  yet  to  come up  with  strategies and proper \\nsolutions?  Kenya  is  a  natural  resource-based  economy,  meaning  we  are  completely  at  the \\nmercy of rains to direct how we feed ourselves. In that case then, what can we do? Top in my \\nmind is whether we can have an aggressive campaign to make our country green. To that effect, \\nthe  residents  in  counties  like  Wajir  are  not  farmers  but  nomads,  but  we  are  still  one  of  the \\nbiggest food consumers.  \\n\\nMy challenge today would be to first come up with solutions. We have countries like \\nIsrael that have completely found a solution to feed their people. For mangoes from Ijara Sub-\\ncounty, we use water from Tana River for irrigation. Mangoes from our farms do very well. \\nWe  also  supply  a  lot  of  lemon  and  watermelons.  I  suggest  that  we  have  inter-county  trade \\ninitiatives and ask counties to find ways to provide food for their people.  \\n\\nThe  leather  market,  for  instance,  is  currently  at  407  billion  dollars.  Our  animals  are \\ndying. It is, therefore, important that we have county-based tanneries and meat commissions \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

That is one of the solutions I am thinking about because drought will always be there. \\nWe just have to find a way to create solutions.  \\n\\nAs  a  lawmaker,  I  understand  we  have  the  National  Climate  Change  Fund  yet  to  be \\noperationalised. The ministries involved need to tell us where we are at. When we talk of this \\nFund,  we  must  not  forget  the  National  Climate  Change  Council  which  is  chaired  by  the \\nPresident. Why has it not met yet? How then as a country can we leverage on what we have \\nlike the existing finances, namely, the National Climate Change Fund and the County Climate \\nChange Fund, to attract more finances? As a nomad and with these Funds, we need to come up \\nwith solutions quickly. When we sit in this House again next year, we should not talk about \\ndrought, but may be, we should talk about how watermelons from Garissa are making their \\nway to Central Kenya and how milk from Central Kenya is making its way to counties that do \\nnot have it. Let us think solution-based since we know the problem. We have described the \\nproblem. We need solutions. We need funds to implement programmes. Now that we know \\nprincipal secretaries positions are being filled, can we have nomads in place so that they can \\nalso find ways to divert funds to support their people? \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Let us have Member for Kiminini. \\nHon.  Bisau  Kakai  (Kiminini,  DAP-K):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker. \\n\\nCongratulations for being elected as Deputy Speaker of this House. \\n\\nWe are living in a country that does not really worry about the disaster cycle. The focus \\nin this country remains just on response and recovery. What we have always done as a country \\nis to ignore the portion of preparedness and mitigation. I am saying this because having had an \\nopportunity to work with the United Nations for close to 22 years in 19 countries, officials of \\nother countries are always very responsive and ready to save lives. \\n\\nWe  have  had  an  opportunity  even  to  come  up  with  a  paper  while  working  in  the \\npresidency.  We  shared  it  with  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  being  the  custodian  of \\ninteracting with the United Nations. By then, up to last year, the United Nations was ready to \\nestablish for us a humanitarian city where we could keep stockpiles from medicines, to food, \\nand come up with the capacity even to establish the Kenya Disaster Management Authority. \\n\\nHowever, we know the disaster cycle very well. In a period of every three to five years, \\nwe know there will be hunger either natural or man-made disasters. Our focus in this country \\nhas  just  remained  on  response.  By  the  time  we  want  to  respond,  there  is  very  little  food  to \\nrespond and very little humanitarian items and example to respond. You remember 2018 when \\nwe had the Solai Dam emergency. It made the Government borrow around to mobilise about a \\nbillion  shillings.  For  what  we  have  put  in  place  or  the  proposal  we  have  done  outside  this \\nHouse, we have had an idea on how we as experts from this country could try to bring resources \\ntogether and mitigate or be more prepared to reduce what we are seeing.  \\n\\nHis Excellency the President talked about food production. But again, producing that \\nfood will not  be very  good if we do not  have mechanisms on how to  stock it. I know most \\nmultilateral  organisations  including  the  United  Nations  really  favour  Kenya  due  to \\ngeographical positioning. From Kenya, they would like to keep their stockpiles here. They have \\nmost of the UN agencies here and are ready to invest here, but it has always been driven from \\na political perspective where people sitting in different offices are not in a position to really \\nunderstand that we have to support it. \\n \\nI am saying that we need to take this issue urgently. We, as a country, need to move \\nfrom  just  focusing  on  response  and  recovery  to  being  prepared  and  ensuring  that  there  is \\ndrought mitigation. Once we are prepared, even if these effects are there, they will be minimal. \\nWhat  is  most  important  is  to  ensure  that  we  have  sufficient  stock  piles,  human  resource \\ncapacity,  but  not  just  a  policy  paper.  I  am  fully  aware  that  the  Member  for  Kikuyu,  Hon. \\nIchung\\xe2\\x80\\x99wah, brought a Bill in this House on disaster management. I know the Bill will be re-\\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

We need to re-look into it, so that it is not only the policy paper, but also we try to \\nbuild an infrastructure. We can use other multilateral agencies to build capacity, ensure that the \\nNational  Disaster  Management  Authority  works  together  with  the  United  Nations,  keep \\nsufficient stocks, and have good humanitarian stocks and food. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I want to leave it at that. As a country, we must move from just \\nmere response and focus more on preparedness and mitigation. We know that in every period \\nof two to five years, there will always be these disasters. From history, there will also be man-\\nmade disasters which occur after every seven to ten years. A good example is the Solai Dam \\ndisaster. We, as a country, need to prepare not only by coming up with a policy, but also put in \\nplace sufficient infrastructure to ensure that we save lives of Kenyans. \\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Kisauni. \\n \\nHon.  Rashid  Bedzimba  (Kisauni,  ODM):  Asante  sana,  Mhe.  Naibu  wa  Spika  kwa \\n \\nkunipatia fursa  ya kupenyeza sauti  yangu katika janga hili la ukame. Lakini, kabla ya hayo, \\nnachukua nafasi hii kumshukuru Mwenyezi Mungu kwa kuniwezesha kuwa katika Bunge la \\nKumi na Tatu. Kama sio uwezo wake, singekuwa hapa. Nina imani nitafanya mema wakati \\nhuu wa kipindi hiki cha miaka mitano.  \\n \\nPili, nachukua fursa hii kukupongeza kwa kuchaguliwa kama Naibu Spika wa Bunge \\nhili  la  Kumi  na  Tatu.  Tuna  imani  utafanya  haki  pamoja  na  Spika  Moses  Wetangula  katika \\nBunge hili, ili wote wapate fursa ya kuzungumza. Nachukua nafasi hii pia kushukuru familia \\nyangu  kwa  kunipa  moyo  na  nguvu  wakati  wa  kampeni,  ili  nisirudi  nyuma  mpaka  nikapata \\nushindi. Nawashukuru sana. Pia, nichukua fursa hii kuwashukuru waungwana wa Kisauni kwa \\nkunichagua kuwa Mjumbe wao na kwa kuniamini ili niweze kuwaakilisha katika Bunge hili la \\nKumi  na  Tatu.  Nina  imani  kwamba  wako  katika  mikono  salama  na  nitakaa  na  wao. \\nTutasaidiana  kwa  hali  na  mali  kuhakikisha  kwamba  eneo  Bunge  letu  la  Kisauni  linasonga \\nmbele.  Baada  ya  kunipumzisha  katika  Bunge  la  Kumi  na  Mbili,  nashukuru  kwa  sababu \\nwaliniamini na wakaona kwamba wamekosa huduma zangu, na nirudi katika Bunge la Kumi \\nna Tatu.  \\n \\nNamshukuru  Mhe.  Rais  kwa  kurudisha  huduma  za  utendakazi  wa  bandari  kwa \\nwapwani. Tunawaomba wawekezaji warudi ili watumie fursa hiyo ili vijana wetu wapate ajira. \\nPia, bandari irudishe ile mfumo wa zamani wa \\xe2\\x80\\x98whitecard\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ili watoto wetu waendelee kupata \\najira. Watoto wetu wamekaa mabarazani. Tuna imani kwamba ikiwa watarudisha hiyo \\xe2\\x80\\x98white \\ncard\\xe2\\x80\\x99 itatusaidia zaidi ili watoto wengi waajiriwe. Kutakuwa na moyo na hata wao watakuwa \\nna ufahamu kwamba baada ya muda fulani, watarudi kufanya kazi na wengine watabadilishana \\nbaada ya miezi mitatu. \\n \\nSuala  la  maskwota  ni  tatizo  kubwa  Pwani,  hasa  Kisauni.  Nina  imani  Serikali  hii  ya \\nawamu  ya  tano  itashughulikia  suala  hili.  Moja  katika  ahadi  walizozitoa  ni  kwamba \\nwataumaliza uskwota na tunasubiri kuona hilo jambo likitekelezwa. \\nUpande  wa  Kisauni,  kuna  amri  za  kufukuzwa  (eviction  orders)  nyingi  zimetoka. \\n \\nHatuingilii mahakama lakini tunaomba wawe na utaratibu wa fikra kwamba unapotoa amri ya \\nkufukuza nyumba zaidi ya elfu moja, unaleta matatizo makubwa. Wanaoteseka ni akina mama \\nna watoto wakati nyumba hizo zinabomolewa. Wale ambao wanadai kuwa zile ardhi ni zao \\nwalikuwa wapi wakati ambapo watu walikuwa wanajenga msingi, wakajenga hadi wakaweka \\npaa na stima?

Nebart Muriuki (Mbeere South, Independent):   Thank you, Hon. Deputy \\nSpeaker,  for  giving  me  the  opportunity.    My  name  is  Eng.  Nebart  Muriuki,  a  born  again \\nChristian from Mbeere South. \\n\\nLet me join my colleagues in thanking and congratulating you and the Speaker for being \\nelected to lead this 13th Parliament. This is my first time in this House. For me to be here, I \\nwould say it was a struggle for the people of Mbeere South. If I may tell this House where I \\nam  coming  from,  in  Mbeere  South,  I  was  the  founder  Member  of  the  United  Democratic \\nAlliance and promoted UDA very aggressively. However, the electoral process of this country \\nput me off, but the people of Mbeere were determined to have me in this House because they \\nhave confidence that I can deliver. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I want to thank my people from Mbeere South because they had \\nto  fight  the tides and waves of Azimio  and Kenya Kwanza to  bring me to  this House as an \\nIndependent  Member.  The  message  which  the  people  of  Mbeere  South  sent  through  this \\nelection  was  that  Mbeere  South  is  committed  to  work  with  the  President  because  they \\noverwhelmingly voted for him too. Embu County is all Kenya Kwanza except from Mbeere \\nSouth where I am an Independent Member. The message they gave me as I came to this House \\nis that I must work with the Government so that I can deliver on the promises that I made to \\nthem. \\n\\nI want to thank them very much for standing with me and ensuring that I come to this \\nHouse. I want to thank them for the confidence and the trust they have in me. I trust that this \\n13th Parliament is going to be different from other Parliaments. We must enact laws which are \\ngoing to facilitate provision of services to our people.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  I  have  been  listening  to  the  debate  and  many  Members  are \\ntalking about problems. However, one speaker has made a very good presentation that since \\n1965 to date, we are still talking about the same problem of drought. Mbeere South, a semi-\\narid and one of the largest constituencies in Embu County, and also the most underdeveloped \\nin that county, has been having the same cycle of drought and hunger.  \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, as I speak, the relief food that was supplied has not reached every \\n \\ncorner of Mbeere South.  This morning, I got a call that some schools have not got any food.  \\nOthers are having problems with water.  Yesterday, I had to supply water to a school because \\nthere was no water.   \\n\\nIn this country, we build capacity, but we do not make use of it. Mbeere South has five \\ndams which are neither used to supply water to the area nor used for irrigation.  As I speak, we \\nare experiencing drought in that sub-county yet we have the capacity to do irrigation and even \\nto provide people with clean water. This problem is not only in Mbeere South. We should also \\nlook at other areas in the country where capacity has been built, but is not being put to work. \\nFor instance, the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), how many\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\n\\nHon.

Kwanza, \\nnachukua nafasi hii kukupongeza kwa kuchaguliwa kuwa Naibu wa Spika wa Bunge hili la \\nKumi  na  Tatu.

Tunapaswa kumudu sehemu kame zote ili ziweze kubadilika na kuwa za manufaa \\nkwa wananchi wetu. Mfano ni eneo la Chakama katika eneo Bunge langu. Ndio, sehemu hii ni \\nkame lakini ardhi ile ina maji ya kutosha.  Kinachohitajika tu ni Serikali kuchukua mikakati \\ninayofaa na kuchimba visima ambavyo vinaendeshwa na nguvu za jua na hivo kunyunyiza maji \\nkwa mashamba na watu waweze kupata chakula cha kutosha.  Vile vile, sehemu zingine kama \\nvile Kanagoni ambazo zimepakana na Mbunge aliyeleta Mswada huu ni sehemu kame.  Lakini, \\nndani ya ardhi hizi, kuna maji ya kutosha ambayo yakiwekewa mikakati inayofaa yanaweza \\nkusaidia wananchi kujiendeleza na kupata chakula cha kutosha. \\n\\nNikimalizia,  tunao  mradi  mkubwa  ndani  ya  kaunti  za  Tana  River  na  Kilifi  ambazo \\nhautusaidii kwa njia yoyote ile. Nitamuuliza mwenzagu, Mhe. Ali Wario, tulete mswada ambao \\nutarudisha mradi huo kwa kaunti hizi mbili ili tuweze kuutumia vyema na watu wetu wasiwe \\nwa kuhangaishwa na njaa kila wakati. Watoto wengi wameacha kusoma kwa sababu ya ukame \\nna njaa. Shule nyingi zinaelekea kufungwa kwa sababu wanafunzi ni haba.   \\n\\nMheshimiwa Naibu Spika, ninaamini ya kuwa Serikali ya Rais William Ruto inaenda \\nkubadilisha maisha ya jamii kwa kuzingatia yale ambayo wameyapanga kwa kuhakikisha ya \\nkwamba wanayafanya yawe ya kweli.  \\n\\nTukizungumzia  hazina  hii  ya  wachochole,  ikiwa  itatumika  vizuri  na  ufisadi  tuweke \\n\\nkando, kwa hakika vijana na akina mama wataweza kufaidi na kuwa na maendeleo. \\n\\nKwa hayo machache au mengi, ninasema asante Mheshimiwa Naibu Spika, hata kwa \\n\\nkuweza kuniona na kunipa nafasi. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for North Horr. \\nHon. Adhe Guyo (North Horr, KANU): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving \\n\\nme this opportunity. \\n\\nI  would  first  like  to  thank  the  Almighty  for  giving  us  the  opportunity  to  be  here.  \\nSecondly, I would like to thank my family, and the great people of North Horr for electing me \\nto this august House.   \\n\\nI want to contribute to the current Motion on the Floor on the issue of drought. Drought \\nhas become a vicious circle. It happens every two years, and continues to claim lives, and the \\nlivelihood  of  the  people.  Unfortunately,  drought  has  become  the  order  of  the  day.  In  my \\nconstituency, people are  dying.  In the past  week, five  elderly people have died.  It  is  not  an \\nexaggeration,  but  a  reality.  About  70  per  cent  of  the  livestock  have  already  perished. \\nUnfortunately,  the  kind  of  intervention  we  are  seeing  on  the  ground  is  quite  insignificant \\nlooking at the impact of the drought. \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  looking  at  the  current  trend,  we  foresee  a  situation  whereby, \\ncome December, we will not have people to represent. We will only have rocks and sand dunes \\nto represent.  It is a high time this House took action to come up with a special House committee \\nto look into the issue of drought in this country.  \\n\\n Some schools have been closed and others are running intermittently. So, basically, \\nthere is a real danger. If the Government will not take any action, we are going to lose the entire \\npopulation in northern Kenya.   \\n\\nI  would  like  to  appreciate  and  commend  the  efforts  of  Non-Governmental \\nOrganizations (NGOs). Were it not for them, we would have lost the entire people in northern \\nKenya and other ASAL counties. The UN Agencies and donor communities have been fast-\\ntracking and proactively moving forward by providing live saving interventions for the people \\nin northern Kenya.  \\n\\n Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  the  resources  that  NGOs  are  using  come  from  foreign \\nGovernments. I do not see the reason why local NGOs in this country are not financed by the \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

If  foreign  countries  are  able  to  entrust  their  resources  with  the  local \\nagencies,  why  then  can  the  Government  not  entrust  its  own  local  institutions  to  provide \\nresources and services to the people? They have proved to be efficient, proactive and it is high \\ntime they looked outside the box to see to it that by being effective, they need to be supported \\nbecause they have gone extra mile to reach areas where the Government is not able to.   \\n\\nWe  have  been  talking  about  the  issue  of  draught  year  in,  year  out.  There  is  a  lot  of \\npotential in the ASALs counties. If Egypt as dry as it is is able to export fruits, rice and other \\nfood products, why is Kenya not able to produce its own fruits and food to feed its people and \\nexport extras to other countries yet we have more potential than Egypt and other dry countries?  \\nWhat this country needs is to think outside the box. They should know that ASAL areas \\nhave a lot of potential. People think that northern Kenya and other ASAL counties lack capacity \\nto  produce  food.  Look  at  what  is  happening  in  Galana-Kulalu  project,  although  it  was \\nmismanaged, we have no similar projects in all the counties in this country.  We would afford \\nto feed our own people and export to other countries and earn foreign exchange. While we are \\nenjoying air-conditioned House here, our people are languishing in hunger and dying. It is not \\nan exaggeration and it is high time we thought about how we can support our communities by \\ncoming up with special House committees to look into this issue of drought. It is a disaster that \\nis taking lives and livelihoods. Through your office, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I really urge this \\nHouse to come up with a special House committee. Thank you very much. \\n \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Likoni Constituency. \\nHon.  Mishi  Mboko  (Likoni,  ODM):  Asante  sana,  Mhe.  Naibu  wa  Spika.  Kwanza \\nningependa kukupatia hongera kwa kuweza kuwa Naibu  wa Spika wa hili  Bunge la kitaifa. \\nUmeweza kuweka nyota ya kina mama ing\\xe2\\x80\\x99are sana katika taifa letu la Kenya. Pia, ningependa \\nkuwapongeza  Spika  Mhe.  Wetang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ula  na  pia  Mhe.  Kingi  ambaye  ameweka  historia  kuwa \\nSpika wa kwanza kutoka Pwani, Kaunti ya Kilifi. Hongera sana. Niwashukuru pia wakaazi wa \\nLikoni  na  wapiga  kura  kwa  kuweza  kuwa  na  imani  na  mimi  kuweza  kunirudisha  tena \\nkuwawakilisha ili niweze kuendeleza maendeleo endelevu.  \\n\\nHaswa leo ningependa kuzumgumzia Hoja hii ya tharura ambayo inazungumzia janga \\nla njaa na niseme ni ukweli takriban zaidi ya watu milioni tatu hivi sasa wamekosa usalama wa \\nchakula katika taifa letu la Kenya. Ukiangalia katika Mkoa wa Pwani , sehemu za Tana pale, \\nsehemu za Kilifi, Kwale na pia upande wa North Eastern, ambapo ni kule tuseme Kaskazini \\nMshariki na pia sehemu za Ukambani na sehemu zingine za Kenya, tumeweza kuwa na ukame \\nna kiangazi kikali sana. Hii ni kwa sababu ya mabadiliko ya hali ya hewa. Swala hili limekuwa \\nswala nyeti na la kilimwengu ambapo inahitajika tuweze kuangalia sera makhsuswa ambazo \\nzitapambana na hali hii ya hewa ambayo inatuletea ukame wa hali ya juu sana. \\n\\nTuweze kuangalia nchi ambazo zimeweza kustawi ama kubobea kwa mfano Misri na \\nIsraeli. Hizi ni nchi ambazo zimekuwa na ukame na zimekuwa za jangwa lakini tunaona ya \\nkwamba wanaweza kupata mazao, chakula na wanaweza kuwa na usalama wa chakula katika \\ntaifa lao.  \\n\\nNingependa  kuzungumzia  madhara  ambayo  yanatufikia  tukiwa  na  janga  la  ukame. \\nTunakuwa na ndoa za haraka kwa sababu mabinti wetu wanatembea kilomita nyingi wakitafuta \\nchakula. Hivyo wanaweza kupambana na wale mabawe wa sukari na kuweza kupata ndoa za \\nharaka. Hili ni jambo ambalo pia linaadhiri elimu katika taifa letu la Kenya. Wanafunzi pia \\nwanashindwa kwenda shule kwa sababu ya njaa, hivyo pia elimu inaweza kudorora. Vile vile, \\ntunaona misafara ya mifugo ikitoka sehemu kadhaa kwenda kutafuta mahali ambapo wanaweza \\nkupata nyasi ama chakula. Jambo hili linaleta uhasama katika jamii zetu na kuleta shida na vita \\nvya  kikabila.  Kwa  mfano,  kuna  ngamia  wengi  wanaotoka  katika  sehemu  ya  Tana  River, \\nsehemu ya Mashariki Kaskazini, wanaotembea mpaka kule Taita Taveta na Kilifi. Hivyo basi, \\nwakaazi wa kule wanaweza kuona ya kwamba huo ni uchokozi na kunaweza kuwa na uhasama \\nwa kijamii. Haya yote yanaletwa na janga la chakula la kitaifa.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Leo uchumi wa samawati unaweza kuleta kilimo cha \\nsamaki ambao hautakuwa lazima tu kwa wale wana bahari ama ziwa. Hata kule ambapo hakuna \\nkunaweza kutengenezwa mabawa na njia za kilimo cha samaki.   \\n\\nHiyo pia ni njia moja ya kuhakikisha kwamba tuna usalama wa chakula. Kule Pwani, \\nmaeneo ya Kwale, Kilifi na Mombasa, tunakosa maji na tuna ule mradi wa Mzima Springs II. \\nMkoloni alianzisha Mzima Springs I lakini haiwezi tosheleza hivi sasa asilimia ya Wakenya \\nambayo imeongezeka marudufu. Kwa hivyo, lazima Serikali iliopo iangalie Mzima Springs II \\nili tuweze kuboresha chakula. \\n\\nVile  vile,  tuwe  na  sera  za  kupambana  na  majanga  ya  kitaifa.  Vile  vile,  vyakula  vya \\nmisaada viende kwa wale ambao wanahusika, isiende kwa watu ambao hawahusiki. Vile vile, \\ntuwe na mpangilio ya chakula kwa watoto wetu wa shule ili tuweze kuboresha elimu haswa \\nkwa wakati huu wa janga hili ambalo tuko nalo.  \\n\\nVyakula vyetu vya utamaduni kama ugali, mchele na vyakula vya nafaka viwekwe kwa \\n\\nbei ya chini kwa sababu Mhe. Rais alisema ataaangalia mahasla. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Runyenjes.  \\nHon. Muchangi Karemba (Runyenjes, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for \\n\\nthe opportunity to contribute to this Motion. First and foremost, I want to congratulate you \\nfor being elected as the Deputy Speaker in the 13th Parliament. Secondly, I wish to thank my \\npeople of Runyenjes Constituency for giving me a second opportunity to serve them. I wish \\nto assure them that I will do it with more dedication and commitment.  \\n \\nYesterday was a very sad day in Runyenjes where we laid to rest some seven people \\nwho perished in a fire tragedy. At this point, I would like to ask the Directorate of Criminal \\nInvestigations (DCI) to fast-track the investigation so that we can understand what happened. \\n \\nI wish to contribute on this matter of drought situation in the country. Kenya has not \\nbeen able to feed its people properly. We cannot move forward as a country. Approximately \\nfive  million  people  are  starving.  The  Government  of  Jomo  Kenyatta  gave  relief  food.  The \\nGovernment of President Moi gave relief food. The Government of Mwai Kibaki did the same. \\nThe Government of Uhuru Kenyatta gave relief food. The Government of William Ruto must \\ndo things differently. We say in English it is only a fool who does the same thing the same way \\nand expect different results. Why do we have this situation right now? It is because of climate \\nchange. Kenya has only approximately 20 per cent of its land that receives sufficient rainfall. \\nAbout 80 per cent does not receive sufficient rainfall. It means that it is only people who live \\nin those areas that receive sufficient rainfall that can give us food, but they are too few to give \\nus sufficient food.  \\n\\nAll  over  the  world,  we  have  success  stories  of  countries  that  have  managed  to  give \\nenough food. For instance,  India has over 1.4 billion people and it gives enough food  to  its \\npeople. China has 1.3 billion people and it feeds all its people. That never used to be. They put \\na lot of their land under cultivation. In India alone, 51 per cent of its land is under irrigation. In \\nChina, 41 per cent is under irrigation. In Egypt, which is a desert, they have been able to supply \\nthe world with rice. It means that if we must move on as a country, we must stop relying on \\nrain for farming. \\n\\nWe must go the irrigation way. If, for example, the dam proposed for construction at \\nThuci within my constituency is constructed, it would mean that four constituencies, namely, \\nRunyenjes, Chuka/Igambang\\xe2\\x80\\x99ombe, Tharaka and Mbeere North can sufficiently do farming. \\nSo, I urge the Government  of Kenya, led by His  Excellency the President William  Ruto,  to \\ngive priority to irrigation farming. If we do this, in a few years, Kenya will adequately supply \\nits people with enough food, and possibly, even get enough to give to neighbouring countries.  \\n\\nWith those few remarks, I thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker: Let us have the Member for Njoro Constituency. \\nHon.  Charity  Chepkwony  (Njoro,  UDA):  Thank  you  very  much,  Hon.  Deputy \\nSpeaker, for granting me this time. Let me first start by thanking the Almighty God for giving \\nus this opportunity. Let me also take this opportunity to thank the people of Njoro Constituency \\nfor re-electing me as their Member of Parliament. Let me also take this time to thank Kenyans \\nfor electing our able President William Samoei Ruto. I also take this time to congratulate you \\nas our Deputy Speaker. In the same line, I also thank Kenyans for electing women and electing \\nCharity Kathambi Chepkwony as a Member of Parliament for Njoro Constituency.  \\n\\nLet me go to today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s topic in relation to drought. When we talk about drought in this \\nNational  Assembly,  what  comes  to  my  mind  is  to  remind  Members  of  Parliament  and  the \\ncountry that this is part of climate change. Climate change is real, and it is affecting us. We \\nhave seen floods and are now talking about drought as a Motion in this Parliament. We have \\nexperienced many challenges.  \\n\\nMy issue is that as we talk about drought, it is now almost 60 years since Independence. \\nNow that we have elected a very capable Parliament and Government, led by His Excellency \\nPresident William Samoei Ruto, I propose that we now talk about short-term and long-term \\nways of mitigating drought and adopting solutions for the country.  \\n\\nWhen we talk about  drought,  most people might think that Nakuru County is  not  as \\naffected as other areas in the northern part of Kenya. But I would like to say that I come from \\na constituency where three out of six wards are experiencing drought, and even the other three \\nremaining wards still have some affected areas. I confirm that currently in some areas in my \\nconstituency, there are some students who cannot attend classes because they cannot even get \\nfood to eat. Therefore, as we talk about drought in this country, it should be noted that if this \\ncountry does not take serious measures, this might be a story. But for now, I have a lot of hope \\nthat the Kenya Kwanza Government will take serious measures.  \\n\\nLet me also congratulate His Excellency the President for taking action in relation to \\nagriculture. The Government has taken an intentional action to ensure that we have affordable \\nfertilisers. We expect smart agriculture to be introduced in this country. Since the President \\nwill be one of the persons who will lead the Climate Change Council,  I  hope he will effect \\nsmart agriculture to ensure that we minimise or end drought in this country. That will make \\nthis country better.  \\n\\nLastly, thank you for giving me this opportunity. This is a good Motion that we should \\n\\nall act on to ease the pressure of drought in this country. Thank you. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Teso South. \\n \\n \\nHon. Mary Emaase (Teso South, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for this \\nopportunity. I have been waiting patiently. Yesterday the Leader of the Majority Party donated \\none minute to me and I was only able to thank the people of Teso South for giving me another \\nopportunity to serve them in the 13th Parliament, having given me the first opportunity to serve \\nthem in the 11th Parliament. Allow me to congratulate you and the Speaker on being elected to \\nthe position of Deputy Speaker and Speaker, respectively. Let me also take this opportunity to \\ncongratulate the President and the Deputy President on their election. \\n \\nLet  me weigh in  on today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Motion on drought.  I want  to  agree  with  Members who \\nhave already spoken that the drought being experienced in this country this time round is the \\nworst ever. It has not only affected the ASAL regions, but it has been felt across the country, \\nincluding in Busia County and in particular in Teso South where I come from. I want to confess \\nthat a number of families in  Teso South  sleep on a  cup of porridge  a day. They  can hardly \\nafford two kilograms of unga to provide a meal for their families. Whereas we know that the \\nASAL regions are the most hit by drought, I know there is a pocket in every county or sub-\\ncounty experiencing the impact of the prolonged drought across the country. As we plead with \\nthe Government to intervene and provide relief food and support to the affected regions, I also \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

There are \\ntimes when we get a lot of water and it all goes to waste. The National Drought Management \\nAuthority should develop policies and programmes that will address these issues and promote \\nwater  harvesting  techniques.  We  should  also  enhance  water  tracking  in  ASAL  regions  and \\nprovide more storage facilities so that water is available in all affected regions.  \\n \\nThere is need to have a livestock-buying programme, especially during drought. We \\ncan sell the livestock and use the money to support the families most affected by drought. This \\nis a serious issue. We must seriously consider all avenues on how to mitigate it so that Kenyans \\ndo not continue suffering because of drought in this age and time. Thank you, Hon. Deputy \\nSpeaker, for the opportunity. \\n \\n \\nkunipatia nafasi hii adhimu ili nizungumze katika Bunge hili la Kumi na Tatu. \\n\\nHon.

Sehemu  hizi  zimepigwa  pakubwa  na  janga  hili  la \\nukame. Kuna sehemu iitwayo Marere ambapo maji yanakauka. Maji haya ya Marere yanatoka \\nKwale  lakini  yanatumika  katika  kaunti  nyingine.  Wananchi  wa  Kwale  wanakufa  kiu  kwa \\nsababu  inasemekana  kuna  sheria  ya  miaka  ya  sitini  ambayo  inasema  maji  haya  yatatumika \\nkatika sehemu  nyingine  za taifa hili  kwa kuwa maji  ni  haki  ya Mkenya  yeyote  yule.  Lakini \\nMkwale anaumia. Napata kuwa kuna vidimbwi vikubwa vikubwa sehemu nyingine za Kenya, \\nlakini bado Kaunti ya Kwale haijabahatika kupata vidimbwi hivyo vikubwa kusaidia kaunti ile.  \\n \\nSehemu  kubwa  ya  Kaunti  ya  Kwale  ni  ya  ukulima.  Hata  hivyo,  ukulima  hauwezi \\nkufanyika  kwa  sababu  hakuna  maji.  Katika  ile  hotuba  ya  Rais,  naomba  Kwale  iwe  kati  ya \\nkaunti  zitakazotambuliwa  na  kusaidika.  Ndio  maana  niko  hapa  ili  niwakilishe  wananchi  wa \\nKwale walio na kilio kikubwa. Hivi sasa, ninapozungumza, kuna wanyama wameletwa sehemu \\nya Kwale. Maelfu ya ngamia na ng\\xe2\\x80\\x99ombe ambao wametoka sehemu tofauti tofauti wako Lunga \\nLunga  na  Kinango.  Kwa  sababu  sisi  Wakwale  ni  wakarimu,  tumenyamaza  lakini  tunaumia. \\nImezidi kutuumiza kwa sababu ya janga hili. Imezidi kufagia nyasi, mifugo na hata mchanga \\nwetu.  Endapo  mvua  itanyesha  wakati  wowote  kutoka  sasa,  basi  Kaunti  ya  Kwale  itakuwa \\nkatika  zile  kaunti  zitakazoathirika  na  mmomonyoko  wa  ardhi.  Nikiangalia,  kaunti  nyingine \\nziliboreshewa mimea yao katika Serikali iliyopita. \\n\\nMfano  wa  hii  mimea  ni  pamba,  kahawa  na  majani.  Kaunti  ya  Kwale  ina  mimea \\ntakribani  kama  mitatu,  korosho,  mnazi  na  mzingefuri,  lakini  haijawahi  kuboreshwa. \\nHaijapatiwa pesa ya kuboresha mimea hiyo hata siku moja. Ndio maana Mhe. Naibu Spika, \\nwatu wa Kwale walinichagua wakasema niende katika Bunge la Kitaifa nikawalilie kilio chao. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.
